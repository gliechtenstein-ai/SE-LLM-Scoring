However, it is important to remember that active listening is key in building rapport and understanding the customer's specific needs. By actively listening and engaging with the customer's concerns, Luiz can demonstrate a deeper understanding of their pain points and tailor the conversation to address those needs more effectively. Encouraging Luiz to ask open-ended questions and actively listen to the customer's responses can help him better guide the conversation and showcase his expertise in a way that resonates with the customer. Remember, the goal is to create a collaborative and consultative relationship with the customer, so focusing on their needs and actively engaging with them will ultimately lead to more successful outcomes.\",\n",

Encouraging Luiz to actively listen to the customer's feedback and ask clarifying questions can help in honing in on the most relevant information. Additionally, practicing active listening and summarizing key points throughout the conversation can help ensure that the demo remains focused and tailored to the customer's needs. Overall, Luiz's ability to understand and address customer concerns is a valuable skill that can be further enhanced with a more targeted approach.\",\n",

Encouraging Luiz to ask more probing questions during the discovery phase can help uncover these specific needs and allow for a more targeted and impactful demo. Additionally, incorporating more interactive elements such as live demonstrations or hands-on exercises can further engage the audience and showcase the platform's capabilities in a more dynamic way. Keep up the great work, Luiz, and continue to refine your demo to make it even more impactful and tailored to each prospect's unique needs.\",\n",

Additionally, incorporating real-world examples or analogies can help bridge the gap between technical details and the customer's comprehension. By refining these communication skills, Luiz can elevate the overall effectiveness of his demos and build stronger connections with potential clients.\"}"

Our goal - as we have discussed ad nauseam - is to get the technical win; to get the customer to say YES. However, if we confuse our audience along the way - even if they're impressed with what they see - the answer will be NO. Please keep this in mind as you're giving your demonstrations. Not only do we want them to like us, like our product and the company; not only do we want them to see that our solution can help them meet their needs; we need to make sure that they understand what it is that we have demonstrated.

What are some ways in which you can diffuse a situation in which a salesperson has oversold a solution or overstated what the software can do? The following is a list of statements that you can make to downplay and redirect the conversation without making anyone look bad: What Bill said is true under certain circumstances, but given what you are trying to do… What Jason said is partially true, but the other side of the coin is… The fundamentals of what Mary said are true, but there are some specifics that may need clarification . What have we done here? First and foremost, we are being respectful to our sales counterparts. We're not throwing them under the bus. We're not saying No, that's not right. We're acknowledging the point they were trying to make. But then clarifying the point for the customer or prospect so we haven't left them with an expectation that the software cannot live up to. INSIGHT: To be sure I'm oversimplifying and generalizing here, but I do so to make a point. We tend to be driven more by our engineering background than our desire to close a deal.

Whether you are a sales engineer, depend on sales engineers to close business, or manage sales teams that include sales engineers, you will benefit from this book. How do I define sales engineer? Anyone who is in what the industry commonly refers to as technical presales fits into this category. Traditionally, these are the engineers and technical experts within a software company that give product demonstrations in the context of a sales opportunity. You may or may not think of yourself as a sales engineer. You might not have the title of sales engineer.

Luiz did well in providing a comprehensive overview of the platform's capabilities, but there is an opportunity to further customize the demo to address the pain points and challenges that the prospect may be facing. Encouraging Luiz to ask more probing questions during the discovery phase can help uncover these specific needs and allow for a more targeted and impactful demo. Additionally, incorporating more interactive elements such as live demonstrations or hands-on exercises can further engage the audience and showcase the platform's capabilities in a more dynamic way.

It\\'s the corporate headquarters of a well-known Fortune 500 company. The grass out front is perfectly manicured. The leaves of the palm trees in front are swaying gently from a light, warm breeze blowing. You and your sales counterpart are there for a sales presentation and demo. It\\'s the culmination of weeks of planning and preparation. The two of you have worked together for years and have a great partnership. You\\'re a great \"one-two punch\", as they say. A few weeks back you hosted a technical discovery call and have a very good understanding of what the customer is looking for. More importantly, you\\'re confident you know what you need to show, say, and do to get the technical win. You have your demo built, and your story is ready. Everything is set up for success. The expected participants are in the room - about 8 people from the prospective company - and the meeting begins. Your colleague opens with a handful of slides. The customer is engaged and attentive. He gets to his final slide and hands the stage to you. You launch into you demo and give a brief intro. You describe your understanding of the issues they are trying to address and empathize with their predicament, explaining that it\\'s something you see regularly. You call attention to a few of the common symptoms of what they',\n",

Do some discovery at the very beginning of your demo. If you discover that one thing that will make the sale, but it isn't part of your canned demo.

Was it a weakness in the product? Was it a lack of knowledge or familiarity on your part? Did you find yourself painted into a corner as a result of anything you demonstrated? Take notes throughout your demo on things that you need to research, or change, or clean up. If you don\\'t have pen and paper, make mental notes as you go. The answers to all these questions indicate things that you can do to improve the demo before your next customer engagement. In some cases, there may not have been any negative moments in the demo, per se. There were no questions you couldn\\'t answer, no requirements you couldn\\'t address, etc. But the demo just felt a little flat at times. The story was a bit weak. The data was limited or inconsistent. The message was choppy. There are a range of things that can typically be done to spice up a demo and make it more enticing and engaging. Don\\'t wait until the next demo request to address these items. Before you receive another demo request and find yourself thrust back into the cycle of probe-prepare-practice-perform, take time to do some research. Clean up, fix, or enhance some aspect of the demo under non-urgent conditions. Let\\'s take a page out of Steven Covey\\'s \"The Seven Habits of Highly',\n",
       "   'Develop the habit of preparing for demos with effectiveness and efficiency. It requires focus and discipline. The key is to remember the difference between preparing WHAT you are going to show (the demo content ) vs. what you are going to SAY, and how and when you are going to say it (the demo story ). Prepare extra or custom content only as necessary. Focus more on customizing the demo story. Prepare content with the story in mind. Remember, we tend to prepare more material than we can show in the time we have. As a result, we end up rushing through the most important content, and we water down our most important messages. Have the discipline to prepare as necessary but resist the temptation to over-prepare. Focus on your customer and their requirements, not your solution and what you like to talk about or demonstrate. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Build demo content plan and demo script outline based on what you heard during technical discovery 2. Strike a balance between the two 3. Negotiate enough time to prepare 4. Do so diligently and efficiently 5. Be sure to leave time to work on the demo story 6. Avoid preparing more than you can show in the time you have 7. Aim to fill 50% of your allotted time with demo content 8. Remember the rule of the Capital T 9. Avoid the iceberg affect 10. Remember, often times, Less is More']},\n",

This is another way in which we can lose or confuse our customers. We make the mistake of assuming they understand our terminology . Let me assure you, in most cases, there are no bonus points for using high-tech, smart sounding words and terms if our audience doesn\\'t understand them. Frankly, it makes us sound pompous and arrogant, and we run the risk of insulting them, in addition to confusing them. Allow me to share a real-world example. I worked for a software company and one of the most compelling capabilities in the product was a mechanism called a \"region\". It was a rules engine that could be configured to display data-driven visual indicators. To be sure, the name was completely and totally misleading and confusing. Yet, in the early days of giving demos - before we implemented the best practices I\\'m talking about in this book - we would go to great lengths talking about regions , and what could be done with them, how powerful they were, etc. I remember to this day, observing a demo by one of my colleagues and after about 10 minutes of listening to the power of regions and what they could be used for, the key stakeholder in the room raised his hand and said, \"I\\'m sorry, what\\'s a region?\" The previous ten minutes of the demo were completely',\n",

Our goal - as we have discussed ad nauseam - is to get the technical win; to get the customer to say YES. However, if we confuse our audience along the way - even if they're impressed with what they see - the answer will be NO. Please keep this in mind as you're giving your demonstrations.

      "Answer: Luiz demonstrated a strong understanding of the platform's features and capabilities, showcasing his technical expertise effectively. His detailed explanations and examples were valuable in helping the customer understand the product better. Moving forward, it would be beneficial for Luiz to strike a balance between providing technical details and keeping the conversation at a level that is easily digestible for the customer. Encouraging him to gauge the customer's level of technical knowledge and adjust his explanations accordingly will help ensure that the customer remains engaged and does not feel overwhelmed. Additionally, incorporating more real-world use cases and benefits into his explanations can help make the information more relatable and impactful for the customer. Overall, Luiz is on the right track, and with some adjustments, he can further enhance his communication skills and provide even more value to customers during sales conversations.\n",

In their words, \"They allow Perfection to become the enemy of Good Enough.\" Please understand what I\\'m saying here.

There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process. Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers. Clarifying roles and responsibilities For the partnership to function properly, it is critical that both parties understand the division of roles and who owns what.

It\\'s impractical to attempt to do so. Like the marathon runner, we should leave the final \"6 miles\" to the energy and adrenaline of the day. INSIGHT: One of the complaints I consistently hear from SE managers is around this notion of striving for perfection. They argue that one of their biggest issues is some of their SEs waste time prepping for demos because they are striving for perfection. In their words, \"They allow Perfection to become the enemy of Good Enough.\" Please understand what I\\'m saying here. I\\'m not suggesting that you strive for perfection at the expense of good enough. What I\\'m suggesting is to practice the habit of continual improvement. However, do be careful not to let \\'perfection\\' become the enemy of \\'good enough\\' (or your managers may come after me with shovels and pitch forks). Think \"Pursuit of Mastery\" When I say that Habit #6 is to perfect the demo, think the pursuit of mastery .

If that is the case, you want to make sure that you are prioritizing those inquiries that are of highest value to you and the company. The goal is to work those opportunities in which we are engaged at the right level, tied to a budget, one a timeline, etc. Ideally you want to support \"real opportunities\" as opposed to scenarios in which the prospect is just \"kicking the tires\". Not that we never make time for \"informational\" demos that may lead to an opportunity down the road, but when you have competing requests and obligations, you want to be sure you are prioritizing correctly. Schedule time for technical discovery We will cover technical discovery in depth in the next chapter. However, in the context of Habit #1, it\\'s important to establish as a foundational understanding between you and your sales reps that technical discovery is something you require. Establish, up front, that you expect to have the opportunity to host a technical discovery call before a meeting is scheduled.

They ask the overarching question, listen to the response, and then ask a follow-on question which is completely unrelated to what the prospect has just shared with them. This is such a big mistake. It gives the impression that they were not paying any attention to the response, and frankly, that they just don\\'t care. To illustrate this point - how to start with a key question and then follow it with more probing questions - see the graphic on the next page. The first figure represents an effective Q&A session, in which each question spawns from something the customer said. It represents the ideal flow of a discovery call. The second figure represents an ineffective flow.

If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage.

It\\'s impractical to attempt to do so. Like the marathon runner, we should leave the final \"6 miles\" to the energy and adrenaline of the day. INSIGHT: One of the complaints I consistently hear from SE managers is around this notion of striving for perfection. They argue that one of their biggest issues is some of their SEs waste time prepping for demos because they are striving for perfection. In their words, \"They allow Perfection to become the enemy of Good Enough.\" Please understand what I\\'m saying here. I\\'m not suggesting that you strive for perfection at the expense of good enough. What I\\'m suggesting is to practice the habit of continual improvement. However, do be careful not to let \\'perfection\\' become the enemy of \\'good enough\\' (or your managers may come after me with shovels and pitch forks). Think \"Pursuit of Mastery\" When I say that Habit #6 is to perfect the demo, think the pursuit of mastery . In his book \"Drive\", Daniel Pink sites mastery as one of the three elements of what he calls Motivation 2.0, the theory that intrinsic drives are more powerful than extrinsic drives. He compares mastery to an asymptote. You may have learned the term',\n",

And typically, when you least expect it. The best laid plans, as they say, tend to go awry. As a good friend of mine once said, \"Life is what happens when you\\'ve made other plans.\" No truer statements can be said of a software demo. As',\n",

The point is that it\\'s not realistic to think that we can create the perfect demo and attempt to prepare, in advance, every single thing we might have to cover. It\\'s impractical to attempt to do so. Like the marathon runner, we should leave the final \"6 miles\" to the energy and adrenaline of the day. INSIGHT: One of the complaints I consistently hear from SE managers is around this notion of striving for perfection. They argue that one of their biggest issues is some of their SEs waste time prepping for demos because they are striving for perfection. In their words, \"They allow Perfection to become the enemy of Good Enough.\" Please understand what I\\'m saying here. I\\'m not suggesting that you strive for perfection at the expense of good enough. What I\\'m suggesting is to practice the habit of continual improvement. However, do be careful not to let \\'perfection\\' become the enemy of \\'good enough\\' (or your managers may come after me with shovels and pitch forks). Think \"Pursuit of Mastery\" When I say that Habit #6 is to perfect the demo, think the pursuit of mastery . In his book \"Drive\", Daniel Pink sites mastery as one of the three elements of what he calls Motivation 2.0, the theory that intrinsic drives are more powerful than extrinsic drives. He compares mastery to an asymptote. You may have learned the term']}}"

The thrill of being presented with a challenging set of requirements to address and delivering the ideal demo. But if there\\'s anything I\\'ve learned in this business, there are very few \"instruction manuals\" on how to be a successful sales engineer. So how do we do this? How do we achieve the technical win and meet our own objectives? And how do we do it on a consistent, reliable, and predictable basis? The book you\\'re holding in your hands, of course, is going to walk step by step through the six habits just introduced. But before we get into that, let\\'s just answer this question notionally. How do we achieve the technical win? It begins by',\n",
       "   'Taking a page out of, \"Great Demo!\" by Peter Cohan, I\\'m going to do the last thing first. That\\'s right, I\\'m going to answer the most important question right now. What are The Six Habits of Highly Effective Sales Engineers? 1. Partner - Habit #1 is to partner with your sales counterpart. To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2. Probe - Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers\\' objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind. This requires a very keen understanding of the difference between preparing demo content vs. preparing the demo script or story. In this chapter, I will reveal the most common mistakes SEs make and time wasters that interfere with preparing for demos. We\\'ll walk through a plan for how to stay']}}"

Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers. Clarifying roles and responsibilities For the partnership to function properly, it is critical that both parties understand the division of roles and who owns what.

Simply put, when you give a demonstration, no matter what, be yourself . As the very name of this chapter suggests - PERFORM - I do think of a software demonstration as a performance.

We have to be \"on\". I think some people may be uncomfortable with this idea - that a software demonstration is a performance .

(And I'm certain none of you would make this mistake.) But I go to this length to emphasize the point. Seek feedback along the way. Stay tuned in to where your audience is and bring them along for the ride. I'm a little uncomfortable with this - seek feedback You might be uncomfortable with this - drawing people out.

       "   'Congratulations! You\\'ve made it to the final chapter of the book. If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them. And typically, when you least expect it. The best laid plans, as they say, tend to go awry.

The point is that it\\'s not realistic to think that we can create the perfect demo and attempt to prepare, in advance, every single thing we might have to cover. It\\'s impractical to attempt to do so. Like the marathon runner, we should leave the final \"6 miles\" to the energy and adrenaline of the day. INSIGHT: One of the complaints I consistently hear from SE managers is around this notion of striving for perfection. They argue that one of their biggest issues is some of their SEs waste time prepping for demos because they are striving for perfection. In their words, \"They allow Perfection to become the enemy of Good Enough.\" Please understand what I\\'m saying here. I\\'m not suggesting that you strive for perfection at the expense of good enough. What I\\'m suggesting is to practice the habit of continual improvement. However, do be careful not to let \\'perfection\\' become the enemy of \\'good enough\\' (or your managers may come after me with shovels and pitch forks). Think \"Pursuit of Mastery\" When I say that Habit #6 is to perfect the demo, think the pursuit of mastery . In his book \"Drive\", Daniel Pink sites mastery as one of the three elements of what he calls Motivation 2.0, the theory that intrinsic drives are more powerful than extrinsic drives. He compares mastery to an asymptote. You may have learned the term',\n",

If that is the case, you want to make sure that you are prioritizing those inquiries that are of highest value to you and the company. The goal is to work those opportunities in which we are engaged at the right level, tied to a budget, one a timeline, etc. Ideally you want to support \"real opportunities\" as opposed to scenarios in which the prospect is just \"kicking the tires\". Not that we never make time for \"informational\" demos that may lead to an opportunity down the road, but when you have competing requests and obligations, you want to be sure you are prioritizing correctly. Schedule time for technical discovery We will cover technical discovery in depth in the next chapter. However, in the context of Habit #1, it\\'s important to establish as a foundational understanding between you and your sales reps that technical discovery is something you require.

They ask the overarching question, listen to the response, and then ask a follow-on question which is completely unrelated to what the prospect has just shared with them. This is such a big mistake. It gives the impression that they were not paying any attention to the response, and frankly, that they just don\\'t care. To illustrate this point - how to start with a key question and then follow it with more probing questions - see the graphic on the next page. The first figure represents an effective Q&A session, in which each question spawns from something the customer said. It represents the ideal flow of a discovery call.

       "   'Taking a page out of, \"Great Demo!\" by Peter Cohan, I\\'m going to do the last thing first. That\\'s right, I\\'m going to answer the most important question right now. What are The Six Habits of Highly Effective Sales Engineers? 1. Partner - Habit #1 is to partner with your sales counterpart. To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2. Probe - Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers\\' objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind. This requires a very keen understanding of the difference between preparing demo content vs. preparing the demo script or story. In this chapter, I will reveal the most common mistakes SEs make and time wasters that interfere with preparing for demos. We\\'ll walk through a plan for how to stay',\n",
       "   \"Let's go a step further. What exactly does it mean to be in sales? Sales is a courtship. We need to interact with prospects and customers the same way we would if we were courting someone - because that's EXACTLY what we are doing! If you're married or in a long-term relationship, I want you to think back to your first couple of dates. Did you act then the way you do now? Of course not! And how did you act differently? Here are some guidelines: 1. We ALWAYS put our best foot forward - with respect to ourselves, our solutions, and our company. 2. We ALWAYS act on our best behavior. We use our best manners. 3. We ALWAYS represent the company, our software, and our colleagues in the highest regard. 4. We NEVER air our dirty laundry - whether about our company, the product, our colleagues, etc. You might be saying to yourself, why would you even mention these things? They seem so obvious. So basic. My answer: you would not believe how many times I've attended a demonstration in which the sales engineer was grumpy about something - the company, his sales counterparts, the product, etc. and made his/her disapproval known openly and often. I've seen sales engineers get belligerent with prospects. I've seen them get defensive, rude, arrogant, insulted by questions, etc. etc. The list frankly goes on and on. We are in sales.

Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers. Clarifying roles and responsibilities For the partnership to function properly, it is critical that both parties understand the division of roles and who owns what.

If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect.

It\\'s impractical to attempt to do so. Like the marathon runner, we should leave the final \"6 miles\" to the energy and adrenaline of the day. INSIGHT: One of the complaints I consistently hear from SE managers is around this notion of striving for perfection. They argue that one of their biggest issues is some of their SEs waste time prepping for demos because they are striving for perfection. In their words, \"They allow Perfection to become the enemy of Good Enough.\" Please understand what I\\'m saying here. I\\'m not suggesting that you strive for perfection at the expense of good enough. What I\\'m suggesting is to practice the habit of continual improvement. However, do be careful not to let \\'perfection\\' become the enemy of \\'good enough\\' (or your managers may come after me with shovels and pitch forks).

If that is the case, you want to make sure that you are prioritizing those inquiries that are of highest value to you and the company. The goal is to work those opportunities in which we are engaged at the right level, tied to a budget, one a timeline, etc. Ideally you want to support \"real opportunities\" as opposed to scenarios in which the prospect is just \"kicking the tires\". Not that we never make time for \"informational\" demos that may lead to an opportunity down the road, but when you have competing requests and obligations, you want to be sure you are prioritizing correctly. Schedule time for technical discovery We will cover technical discovery in depth in the next chapter. However, in the context of Habit #1, it\\'s important to establish as a foundational understanding between you and your sales reps that technical discovery is something you require.

They ask the overarching question, listen to the response, and then ask a follow-on question which is completely unrelated to what the prospect has just shared with them. This is such a big mistake. It gives the impression that they were not paying any attention to the response, and frankly, that they just don\\'t care. To illustrate this point - how to start with a key question and then follow it with more probing questions - see the graphic on the next page. The first figure represents an effective Q&A session, in which each question spawns from something the customer said. It represents the ideal flow of a discovery call. The second figure represents an ineffective flow.

In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2. Probe - Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers\\' objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind.

In this chapter, I will reveal the most common mistakes SEs make and time wasters that interfere with preparing for demos. We\\'ll walk through a plan for how to stay',\n",

The central theme being \"Sales is a team sport\". Habit #2 - to PROBE into customer requests for a demonstration to understand their objectives, requirements, etc. and the importance of hosting a Technical Discovery Call. Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\". If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\". They are all related to what happens before the demo. They are critically important to and will go a long way towards ensuring our success. But at the end of the day, at some point, the spotlight is going to be on us. Our sales counterpart is going to say what he or she has to say, for better or for worse, and then they are going to \\'hand',\n",

If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them.

It\\'s impractical to attempt to do so. Like the marathon runner, we should leave the final \"6 miles\" to the energy and adrenaline of the day. INSIGHT: One of the complaints I consistently hear from SE managers is around this notion of striving for perfection. They argue that one of their biggest issues is some of their SEs waste time prepping for demos because they are striving for perfection. In their words, \"They allow Perfection to become the enemy of Good Enough.\" Please understand what I\\'m saying here.

However, do be careful not to let \\'perfection\\' become the enemy of \\'good enough\\' (or your managers may come after me with shovels and pitch forks). Think \"Pursuit of Mastery\" When I say that Habit #6 is to perfect the demo, think the pursuit of mastery .

       "   'Congratulations! You\\'ve made it to the final chapter of the book. If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them. And typically, when you least expect it. The best laid plans, as they say, tend to go awry. As a good friend of mine once said, \"Life is what happens when you\\'ve made other plans.\" No truer statements can be said of a software demo. As',\n",

The point is that it\\'s not realistic to think that we can create the perfect demo and attempt to prepare, in advance, every single thing we might have to cover. It\\'s impractical to attempt to do so. Like the marathon runner, we should leave the final \"6 miles\" to the energy and adrenaline of the day. INSIGHT: One of the complaints I consistently hear from SE managers is around this notion of striving for perfection. They argue that one of their biggest issues is some of their SEs waste time prepping for demos because they are striving for perfection. In their words, \"They allow Perfection to become the enemy of Good Enough.\" Please understand what I\\'m saying here. I\\'m not suggesting that you strive for perfection at the expense of good enough. What I\\'m suggesting is to practice the habit of continual improvement. However, do be careful not to let \\'perfection\\' become the enemy of \\'good enough\\' (or your managers may come after me with shovels and pitch forks). Think \"Pursuit of Mastery\" When I say that Habit #6 is to perfect the demo, think the pursuit of mastery . In his book \"Drive\", Daniel Pink sites mastery as one of the three elements of what he calls Motivation 2.0, the theory that intrinsic drives are more powerful than extrinsic drives. He compares mastery to an asymptote. You may have learned the term',\n",

When appropriate, pause for effect. Remember to explain but don\\'t over-explain. Know your \\'ah-ha\\' moments and leverage them effectively. Consistently seek feedback. Leverage the \"mini-close\" to your advantage. Know how to handle setbacks. Do these things and you will dramatically increase your odds for success. Action plan: 1. Be yourself 2. Establish scope and context up front 3. Know the players 4. Be set up and ready to go 5. Begin with the end 6. Explain but don\\'t over explain 7. Use common terminology 8. Slow down 9.

You\\'re assessing the level of engagement so you can determine how much credence or priority you should place on this request. This is particularly important if you support multiple sales reps. If that is the case, you want to make sure that you are prioritizing those inquiries that are of highest value to you and the company. The goal is to work those opportunities in which we are engaged at the right level, tied to a budget, one a timeline, etc. Ideally you want to support \"real opportunities\" as opposed to scenarios in which the prospect is just \"kicking the tires\". Not that we never make time for \"informational\" demos that may lead to an opportunity down the road, but when you have competing requests and obligations, you want to be sure you are prioritizing correctly. Schedule time for technical discovery We will cover technical discovery in depth in the next chapter. However, in the context of Habit #1, it\\'s important to establish as a foundational understanding between you and your sales reps that technical discovery is something you require. Establish, up front, that you expect to have the opportunity to host a technical discovery call before a meeting is scheduled.

They ask the overarching question, listen to the response, and then ask a follow-on question which is completely unrelated to what the prospect has just shared with them. This is such a big mistake. It gives the impression that they were not paying any attention to the response, and frankly, that they just don\\'t care. To illustrate this point - how to start with a key question and then follow it with more probing questions - see the graphic on the next page. The first figure represents an effective Q&A session, in which each question spawns from something the customer said. It represents the ideal flow of a discovery call. The second figure represents an ineffective flow.

That\\'s why you\\'re going onsite to do a demo. The time to solve is coming. That\\'s what your post-sales consultants are responsible for. Remember, your goal is to get the technical win. And the goal of this technical discovery call is to collect as much information as you can to create the best demo possible. The more you talk during this call, the less information you are collecting. Take the trip Aslan Training, a sales training organization based in Atlanta, Georgia has a great term for this. They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe.

In the context of a software demo, all questions are not created equally . What do I mean by that? Some questions are completely and totally irrelevant, as far as the success of the software deal is concerned. However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal. The challenge that we, as sales engineers face, is recognizing questions accordingly and knowing how to handle them, multiple times in any demo, on the fly, in front of an audience. That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ? The answers to these two questions will dictate how we handle questions from the audience.',\n",

Habit #2 - to PROBE into customer requests for a demonstration to understand their objectives, requirements, etc. and the importance of hosting a Technical Discovery Call. Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\". If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\".

Remember, it typically takes four or five rounds of questions to get to the heart of what it is they are trying to accomplish. The time to sell is coming. That\\'s why you\\'re going onsite to do a demo. The time to solve is coming. That\\'s what your post-sales consultants are responsible for. Remember, your goal is to get the technical win. And the goal of this technical discovery call is to collect as much information as you can to create the best demo possible. The more you talk during this call, the less information you are collecting. Take the trip Aslan Training, a sales training organization based in Atlanta, Georgia has a great term for this. They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe.

In the context of a software demo, all questions are not created equally . What do I mean by that? Some questions are completely and totally irrelevant, as far as the success of the software deal is concerned. However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal. The challenge that we, as sales engineers face, is recognizing questions accordingly and knowing how to handle them, multiple times in any demo, on the fly, in front of an audience. That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ? The answers to these two questions will dictate how we handle questions from the audience.',\n",

However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal.

That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2.

Habit #2 - to PROBE into customer requests for a demonstration to understand their objectives, requirements, etc. and the importance of hosting a Technical Discovery Call. Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\". If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\".

This is simply the practice of being ready when called upon. That\\'s it. Simply put, be set up and ready to go when the spotlight shines upon you. In many cases, you will be invited to begin your demo after your sales counterpart has presented a handful of slides - introducing the company, the solution, a case study, etc. When he/she completes their part of the presentation, they will hand the floor to you to begin your demonstration. When this happens, you need to be at the ready to launch straight into your demo. This probably seems so obvious. But I\\'ve seen countless demos in which the SE wasn\\'t ready. Either they had to log into the system. Or they had to \"fire up some services\". Or they had to navigate through five pages or screens to get to their starting point. I\\'ve even witnessed a demonstration given over the web, in which the sales rep finished his slide presentation a few minutes sooner than expected and switched control of the screen over to the SE that was supporting him. When her screen appeared, it was a flyer that she was working on for a bake sale at her kids\\' school! She was only paying half attention to the conversation going on - at best.

Sales meetings that involve a product demonstration tend to follow the same pattern. Either we get the technical win - that\\'s a victory for us. We have a clear fail - \" sorry, not interested \". Or third, we end with a very ambiguous result, whereby the customer seems neither thrilled nor completely turned off. They\\'re sort of tepid on the solution and need more time to consider and discuss. What can be learned from each of these three scenarios? What can we take away from each of these and apply to other deals in pipeline or future deals? What can we learn when we win? When we win, or get the technical win, what was it that seemed to seal the deal? What was it that swayed the customer or prospect in your favor? Was it a key question that was answered? Was it a key capability that you demonstrated? Was it the ability to do something specific with their data or processes? By considering these questions, you may identify new ways to position and talk about your solutions that you hadn\\'t considered before.

To that end, there\\'s a technique we can use to subtly and gently move our audience closer to the technical win and help our sales counterparts close the deal faster, with fewer roadblocks. That technique is referred to as the mini-close . What\\'s a \"mini-close\"? At face value, the mini-close looks a lot like a form of seeking feedback . It comes in the context of a question and is designed to get a response from the customer. However, what differentiates a mini-close from the questions we use to get the customer engaged is they are asked in such a way that require the customer to acknowledge, on some small level, that we\\'ve satisfied one of their requirements. What we are looking for with a mini-close is some level of commitment, if only in the very smallest measure. We are looking for a small step towards achieving the technical win. How does this work? Allow me to explain. If at some point in your demo you ask the following question, \"That was an important point. Did everyone get the significance of that?\" This is clearly an attempt to seek feedback and draw the audience into the conversation - which is a good thing.

That technique is referred to as the mini-close . What\\'s a \"mini-close\"? At face value, the mini-close looks a lot like a form of seeking feedback . It comes in the context of a question and is designed to get a response from the customer. However, what differentiates a mini-close from the questions we use to get the customer engaged is they are asked in such a way that require the customer to acknowledge, on some small level, that we\\'ve satisfied one of their requirements. What we are looking for with a mini-close is some level of commitment, if only in the very smallest measure. We are looking for a small step towards achieving the technical win. How does this work? Allow me to explain. If at some point in your demo you ask the following question, \"That was an important point. Did everyone get the significance of that?\" This is clearly an attempt to seek feedback and draw the audience into the conversation - which is a good thing.

Some questions are completely and totally irrelevant, as far as the success of the software deal is concerned. However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal. The challenge that we, as sales engineers face, is recognizing questions accordingly and knowing how to handle them, multiple times in any demo, on the fly, in front of an audience. That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ? The answers to these two questions will dictate how we handle questions from the audience.',\n",

If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\". They are all related to what happens before the demo. They are critically important to and will go a long way towards ensuring our success. But at the end of the day, at some point, the spotlight is going to be on us. Our sales counterpart is going to say what he or she has to say, for better or for worse, and then they are going to \\'hand']},\n",

       "  'chunks': ['Over the years and after the hundreds of demos I\\'ve both given and observed, there is one truism that I have come to know beyond a fraction of a doubt. In the context of a software demo, all questions are not created equally . What do I mean by that? Some questions are completely and totally irrelevant, as far as the success of the software deal is concerned. However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal. The challenge that we, as sales engineers face, is recognizing questions accordingly and knowing how to handle them, multiple times in any demo, on the fly, in front of an audience. That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ? The answers to these two questions will dictate how we handle questions from the audience.',\n",
       "   'Understand that a software demonstration is a performance. Know how to engage with your audience. Set boundaries and know the players. Expect and answer questions. When appropriate, pause for effect. Remember to explain but don\\'t over-explain. Know your \\'ah-ha\\' moments and leverage them effectively. Consistently seek feedback. Leverage the \"mini-close\" to your advantage. Know how to handle setbacks. Do these things and you will dramatically increase your odds for success. Action plan: 1. Be yourself 2. Establish scope and context up front 3. Know the players 4. Be set up and ready to go 5. Begin with the end 6. Explain but don\\'t over explain 7. Use common terminology 8. Slow down 9. A confused mind always says NO 10. Know and emphasize your aha moments 11. Expect questions 12. Acknowledge the person and the question 13. Assess the person and the question 14. Know how to answer them - The Q&A Quad Chart 15. It\\'s OK to say \"I don\\'t know\" 16. Use the qualified YES 17. Say no without using the word \"no\" 18. The Power of Saying NO 19. Seek feedback along the way 20. Leverage the mini-close Learn and apply these tips. Be patient with the process. It will not come overnight. But over time, you will discover that your performances will improve with every demo and the results will speak for themselves.',\n",
       "   'We talked extensively in Chapter 2 about our role vs. that of our sales counterparts. We established that we are responsible for the technical win, and they are ultimately responsible for revenue, i.e. closing the deal. To that end, there\\'s a technique we can use to subtly and gently move our audience closer to the technical win and help our sales counterparts close the deal faster, with fewer roadblocks. That technique is referred to as the mini-close . What\\'s a \"mini-close\"? At face value, the mini-close looks a lot like a form of seeking feedback . It comes in the context of a question and is designed to get a response from the customer. However, what differentiates a mini-close from the questions we use to get the customer engaged is they are asked in such a way that require the customer to acknowledge, on some small level, that we\\'ve satisfied one of their requirements. What we are looking for with a mini-close is some level of commitment, if only in the very smallest measure. We are looking for a small step towards achieving the technical win. How does this work? Allow me to explain. If at some point in your demo you ask the following question, \"That was an important point. Did everyone get the significance of that?\" This is clearly an attempt to seek feedback and draw the audience into the conversation - which is a good thing. However, let\\'s say, for argument\\'s sake, you\\'ve had good engagement in']},\n",

It also requires the involvement of your sales counterpart - which brings us back to habit #1, the strength of the partnership. After every demo, schedule a debriefing with the sales rep that you partnered with on the demo. Ask him/her for feedback. What did they think worked particularly well? Was there anything they would like to see changed? Were they surprised or disappointed by anything? Was there anything that they were particularly impressed with? Did they see or sense something that maybe you didn't? Also, use this opportunity to provide some feedback to them. Is there anything they could do to better set the stage for the demo?\",\n",
       "   'So, there you have it - the six habits of highly effective sales engineers. If you want to become highly successful in this profession. Become highly sought after as the expert in the field. To be highly paid for your expertise. To be admired and welcomed by customers and revered by colleagues. To have more time for yourself and your family and less stress overall in your life. Learn, develop, and apply these habits and experience the results beyond your wildest expectations. PARTNER with your sales counterpart. You are in sales, and Sales is a Team Sport. PROBE into any request for a demonstration. Master the Technical Discovery Call. PREPARE with the demo in mind. Balance Demo Content with Demo Script. PRACTICE by Clicking Every Click of significance. Avoid surprises on the other side. PERFORM when you take the stage. Follow the best practices to get the Technical Win. PERFECT your demo by applying the principle of Constant and Consistent Improvement. Do these things and you will become a highly effective, highly satisfied, highly sought after, highly compensated sales engineer.',\n",
       "   'There are typically three outcomes from any sales opportunity. We either win the deal, we lose the deal, or the deal just sort of drifts aimlessly without any end in sight. Sales meetings that involve a product demonstration tend to follow the same pattern. Either we get the technical win - that\\'s a victory for us. We have a clear fail - \" sorry, not interested \". Or third, we end with a very ambiguous result, whereby the customer seems neither thrilled nor completely turned off. They\\'re sort of tepid on the solution and need more time to consider and discuss. What can be learned from each of these three scenarios? What can we take away from each of these and apply to other deals in pipeline or future deals? What can we learn when we win? When we win, or get the technical win, what was it that seemed to seal the deal? What was it that swayed the customer or prospect in your favor? Was it a key question that was answered? Was it a key capability that you demonstrated? Was it the ability to do something specific with their data or processes? By considering these questions, you may identify new ways to position and talk about your solutions that you hadn\\'t considered before. It may cause you to rethink the way in which you present certain capabilities or the order and flow of your demos. Pay particularly close attention to the unexpected ah-ha moments.

This can be a sign of better retrieval — with more relevant content. The most important evaluation still comes from RAGAS metrics like Semantic Similarity, Faithfulness, and Context Precision, but this is still an interesting comparison to explore."

Depending of course on the solution you sell, the size of the companies you sell to and other potential dynamics, whenever you give a software demonstration, chances are good that you'll be demonstrating to a group of people, as opposed to just one. Although certainly that happens as well. For arguments sake, let's assume that most of your demos are given to groups of five or more people. In most cases, you're going to have different people with different perspectives, different roles, different interests, and more importantly different responsibilities in the decision-making process - the purchase process. This is particularly true if you sell enterprise software. In fact, studies have shown that in the past five years enterprise software purchase decisions involve more people than ever before. Why is this important? Different people with different roles will have different interests and concerns about your software. The way you communicate and respond to one group needs to be very different from how you respond to others. Let's consider some examples. Some folks in the room will be prospective users of the tool or the platform.

       "   'Over the years and after the hundreds of demos I\\'ve both given and observed, there is one truism that I have come to know beyond a fraction of a doubt. In the context of a software demo, all questions are not created equally . What do I mean by that? Some questions are completely and totally irrelevant, as far as the success of the software deal is concerned. However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal. The challenge that we, as sales engineers face, is recognizing questions accordingly and knowing how to handle them, multiple times in any demo, on the fly, in front of an audience. That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ? The answers to these two questions will dictate how we handle questions from the audience.',\n",
       "   'Let\\'s review what we have covered so far in this book. We opened with the notion that we are in sales and talked about the importance of having that mindset. We established the goal of technical presales which is to get the Technical Win . We have talked through the first four habits, which are: Habit #1 - to PARTNER with our sales counterparts and develop an effective working relationship. The central theme being \"Sales is a team sport\". Habit #2 - to PROBE into customer requests for a demonstration to understand their objectives, requirements, etc. and the importance of hosting a Technical Discovery Call. Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\". If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\". They are all related to what happens before the demo. They are critically important to and will go a long way towards ensuring our success. But at the end of the day, at some point, the spotlight is going to be on us. Our sales counterpart is going to say what he or she has to say, for better or for worse, and then they are going to \\'hand',\n",
       "   \"Technical discovery is different from traditional sales qualification and discovery. We see and hear things different than our sales counterparts. Our goal is to determine what we need to SAY, SHOW, and DO - in the context of the demo - in order to get the technical win. The opposite is to go in blind. Or go into the demo with only the information provided by our sales counterpart, which may or may not be enough for us to give a compelling demo. Every customer, opportunity and/or situation is unique. We need to lead with and demonstrate those capabilities that will mean the most to our audience, not to us. Remember the concept of the newspaper. What section of the newspaper would you read first? Discover the answer to this question for your prospect. Do this by asking good questions, that spawn from their responses. Be conversational. Don't badger the witness. Be effective and efficient with their time. And please remember to just LISTEN! And take good notes. Now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Formulate a plan and save it for the demo. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Discuss the approach with your sales counterpart 2. Budget time for technical discovery 3. Do your homework 4. Prepare a list of questions in advance 5. Ask questions that flow conversationally 6. Follow the prospect or customer wherever they go and ask questions accordingly 7. Lead the witness when appropriate 8. LISTEN,\",\n",
       "   \"The next best practice in delivering a winning demonstration is to know the players . What do we mean by this? Depending of course on the solution you sell, the size of the companies you sell to and other potential dynamics, whenever you give a software demonstration, chances are good that you'll be demonstrating to a group of people, as opposed to just one. Although certainly that happens as well. For arguments sake, let's assume that most of your demos are given to groups of five or more people. In most cases, you're going to have different people with different perspectives, different roles, different interests, and more importantly different responsibilities in the decision-making process - the purchase process. This is particularly true if you sell enterprise software. In fact, studies have shown that in the past five years enterprise software purchase decisions involve more people than ever before. Why is this important? Different people with different roles will have different interests and concerns about your software. The way you communicate and respond to one group needs to be very different from how you respond to others. Let's consider some examples. Some folks in the room will be prospective users of the tool or the platform. They are going to be interested in the specifics and nuances of the tool - how it works, how it will affect their day job, etc. They are going to be more detail- oriented in nature. You will likely have technical influencers in the room.\",\n",
       "   \"What does an effective partnership between sales engineer and sales even look like? Are there specific characteristics that can be readily, commonly identified that indicate partnership effectiveness? A resounding yes. Like all relationships, they will have different dynamics. Each one is unique. But below is a list of the most common aspects of a well-functioning partnership - the profile of an effective sales-SE partnership, if you will. Goals and objectives are clarified and aligned Effective communication between them Mutual respect for one another Division of roles and responsibilities established and clarified Each party takes responsibility for their part of a sale Clear expectations on a consistent basis A feedback loop has been built into the sales process Prioritize the customer and opportunity over personal agenda Show loyalty to the company, the product, and one another Proactively engage one another and their customers Does that sound like an effective partnership to you? Does it sound like the type of working relationship that would enable you to succeed? Do you currently have working relationships like the one described here?

It also requires the involvement of your sales counterpart - which brings us back to habit #1, the strength of the partnership. After every demo, schedule a debriefing with the sales rep that you partnered with on the demo. Ask him/her for feedback. What did they think worked particularly well? Was there anything they would like to see changed? Were they surprised or disappointed by anything? Was there anything that they were particularly impressed with? Did they see or sense something that maybe you didn't? Also, use this opportunity to provide some feedback to them. Is there anything they could do to better set the stage for the demo?\",\n",

       "   'Sales engineers rarely, if ever, work sales opportunities in isolation. As a sale engineer, you will be paired up with one or more sales reps. The quality of your relationship with your \"sales counterparts\", will determine, to a great degree, your job satisfaction and the team\\'s overall success. If you are paired with a single sales rep, the two of you will work in tandem to identify, qualify, advance, and, ideally, close business. This is the model made famous by IBM. An account manager was assigned a sales engineer, and the two worked side by side to manage and execute sales opportunities. It\\'s a model that still exists today in many organizations. You may be assigned to a group of reps that can call on you at any time, regularly pulling you in different directions. You might also find yourself in a matrixed organization, in which case you\\'re one of a pool of resources that any sales rep with a specific requirement can call on.

If we don't follow the habit of probing into customer requests - of running technical discovery calls in advance of a product demo - it basically means we are going in blind to a sales meeting. We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions. The more complex the software you sell and/or the bigger the deal and/or the more people involved in the purchase decision, the more important this is. What sales reps hear correlates to\",\n",

When a requirement is discovered that the software doesn\\'t support particularly well. When some portion of the demo underperforms because of a lack of data or a weak configuration. When some part of the message or story or delivery fails to move the customer across the line. The most effective SEs evaluate what went wrong, identify what needs to be changed, and address it before they find themselves in that situation again. They constantly and consistently strive to perfect their game, perfect their demo. Conversely, if something in a demonstration works particularly well. If some part of the story ends up being the critical moment or a turning point in the conversation, we want to understand and identify that as well. Maybe it was unscripted and just came out \"organically\". If that\\'s the case, this is something that should possibly be integrated into other demonstrations. The bottom line is, we need to learn from every demo and apply those lessons to other deals in the pipeline and future deals down the road. So how do we do this?

That technique is referred to as the mini-close . What\\'s a \"mini-close\"? At face value, the mini-close looks a lot like a form of seeking feedback . It comes in the context of a question and is designed to get a response from the customer. However, what differentiates a mini-close from the questions we use to get the customer engaged is they are asked in such a way that require the customer to acknowledge, on some small level, that we\\'ve satisfied one of their requirements. What we are looking for with a mini-close is some level of commitment, if only in the very smallest measure. We are looking for a small step towards achieving the technical win. How does this work? Allow me to explain. If at some point in your demo you ask the following question, \"That was an important point.

In most cases, you're going to have different people with different perspectives, different roles, different interests, and more importantly different responsibilities in the decision-making process - the purchase process. This is particularly true if you sell enterprise software. In fact, studies have shown that in the past five years enterprise software purchase decisions involve more people than ever before. Why is this important? Different people with different roles will have different interests and concerns about your software. The way you communicate and respond to one group needs to be very different from how you respond to others. Let's consider some examples. Some folks in the room will be prospective users of the tool or the platform.

We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions.

When some part of the message or story or delivery fails to move the customer across the line. The most effective SEs evaluate what went wrong, identify what needs to be changed, and address it before they find themselves in that situation again. They constantly and consistently strive to perfect their game, perfect their demo. Conversely, if something in a demonstration works particularly well. If some part of the story ends up being the critical moment or a turning point in the conversation, we want to understand and identify that as well. Maybe it was unscripted and just came out \"organically\". If that\\'s the case, this is something that should possibly be integrated into other demonstrations. The bottom line is, we need to learn from every demo and apply those lessons to other deals in the pipeline and future deals down the road. So how do we do this?

That technique is referred to as the mini-close . What\\'s a \"mini-close\"? At face value, the mini-close looks a lot like a form of seeking feedback . It comes in the context of a question and is designed to get a response from the customer. However, what differentiates a mini-close from the questions we use to get the customer engaged is they are asked in such a way that require the customer to acknowledge, on some small level, that we\\'ve satisfied one of their requirements. What we are looking for with a mini-close is some level of commitment, if only in the very smallest measure. We are looking for a small step towards achieving the technical win. How does this work? Allow me to explain. If at some point in your demo you ask the following question, \"That was an important point. Did everyone get the significance of that?\" This is clearly an attempt to seek feedback and draw the audience into the conversation - which is a good thing.

What are The Six Habits of Highly Effective Sales Engineers? 1. Partner - Habit #1 is to partner with your sales counterpart. To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2. Probe - Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers\\' objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind.

What separates the highest performing sales engineers from the rest is not just that they prepare, it's the way in which they prepare and what they focus on that makes the difference. One of the most important themes of this chapter is understanding the difference between developing demo content vs. the demo script . Demo content is WHAT we are going to show. The demo script is what we are going to SAY, how we are going to say it, and the order in which we are going to say it. Incidentally, you can also think of this as the story you are going to tell as you flow through the demo. As engineers, we tend to focus on the content - what it is we are building - and not the story. And yet, the story is invariably more important than what we show. Without a story, and without context for how the demonstration the audience is being presented aligns with their objectives, it almost doesn't matter what we build; it's going to fall flat. However, with context, and a compelling story, the content that we build comes alive in the eyes of the audience. Problem is, when many of us prepare for a demo, the 'thing' we are building gets the lion's share of our attention and the story becomes an afterthought. That's precisely what we are going to address in this chapter. Another key theme of this chapter is\"]},\n",

       "   'Over the years and after the hundreds of demos I\\'ve both given and observed, there is one truism that I have come to know beyond a fraction of a doubt. In the context of a software demo, all questions are not created equally . What do I mean by that? Some questions are completely and totally irrelevant, as far as the success of the software deal is concerned. However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal. The challenge that we, as sales engineers face, is recognizing questions accordingly and knowing how to handle them, multiple times in any demo, on the fly, in front of an audience. That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ? The answers to these two questions will dictate how we handle questions from the audience.',\n",
       "   'Let\\'s review what we have covered so far in this book. We opened with the notion that we are in sales and talked about the importance of having that mindset. We established the goal of technical presales which is to get the Technical Win . We have talked through the first four habits, which are: Habit #1 - to PARTNER with our sales counterparts and develop an effective working relationship. The central theme being \"Sales is a team sport\". Habit #2 - to PROBE into customer requests for a demonstration to understand their objectives, requirements, etc. and the importance of hosting a Technical Discovery Call. Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\". If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\". They are all related to what happens before the demo. They are critically important to and will go a long way towards ensuring our success. But at the end of the day, at some point, the spotlight is going to be on us. Our sales counterpart is going to say what he or she has to say, for better or for worse, and then they are going to \\'hand',\n",
       "   \"Technical discovery is different from traditional sales qualification and discovery. We see and hear things different than our sales counterparts. Our goal is to determine what we need to SAY, SHOW, and DO - in the context of the demo - in order to get the technical win. The opposite is to go in blind. Or go into the demo with only the information provided by our sales counterpart, which may or may not be enough for us to give a compelling demo. Every customer, opportunity and/or situation is unique. We need to lead with and demonstrate those capabilities that will mean the most to our audience, not to us. Remember the concept of the newspaper. What section of the newspaper would you read first? Discover the answer to this question for your prospect. Do this by asking good questions, that spawn from their responses. Be conversational. Don't badger the witness. Be effective and efficient with their time. And please remember to just LISTEN! And take good notes. Now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Formulate a plan and save it for the demo. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Discuss the approach with your sales counterpart 2. Budget time for technical discovery 3. Do your homework 4. Prepare a list of questions in advance 5. Ask questions that flow conversationally 6. Follow the prospect or customer wherever they go and ask questions accordingly 7. Lead the witness when appropriate 8. LISTEN,\",\n",
       "   \"The next best practice in delivering a winning demonstration is to know the players . What do we mean by this? Depending of course on the solution you sell, the size of the companies you sell to and other potential dynamics, whenever you give a software demonstration, chances are good that you'll be demonstrating to a group of people, as opposed to just one. Although certainly that happens as well. For arguments sake, let's assume that most of your demos are given to groups of five or more people. In most cases, you're going to have different people with different perspectives, different roles, different interests, and more importantly different responsibilities in the decision-making process - the purchase process. This is particularly true if you sell enterprise software. In fact, studies have shown that in the past five years enterprise software purchase decisions involve more people than ever before. Why is this important? Different people with different roles will have different interests and concerns about your software. The way you communicate and respond to one group needs to be very different from how you respond to others. Let's consider some examples. Some folks in the room will be prospective users of the tool or the platform. They are going to be interested in the specifics and nuances of the tool - how it works, how it will affect their day job, etc. They are going to be more detail- oriented in nature. You will likely have technical influencers in the room.\",\n",
       "   \"What does an effective partnership between sales engineer and sales even look like? Are there specific characteristics that can be readily, commonly identified that indicate partnership effectiveness? A resounding yes. Like all relationships, they will have different dynamics. Each one is unique. But below is a list of the most common aspects of a well-functioning partnership - the profile of an effective sales-SE partnership, if you will. Goals and objectives are clarified and aligned Effective communication between them Mutual respect for one another Division of roles and responsibilities established and clarified Each party takes responsibility for their part of a sale Clear expectations on a consistent basis A feedback loop has been built into the sales process Prioritize the customer and opportunity over personal agenda Show loyalty to the company, the product, and one another Proactively engage one another and their customers Does that sound like an effective partnership to you? Does it sound like the type of working relationship that would enable you to succeed? Do you currently have working relationships like the one described here? What are the things you could be doing differently to develop this kind of partnership? Before we answer those questions, let's consider why this is so difficult to begin with.\",\n",
       "   \"of knowledge or familiarity on your part? Did you find yourself painted into a corner as a result of anything you demonstrated? It also requires the involvement of your sales counterpart - which brings us back to habit #1, the strength of the partnership. After every demo, schedule a debriefing with the sales rep that you partnered with on the demo. Ask him/her for feedback. What did they think worked particularly well? Was there anything they would like to see changed? Were they surprised or disappointed by anything? Was there anything that they were particularly impressed with? Did they see or sense something that maybe you didn't? Also, use this opportunity to provide some feedback to them. Is there anything they could do to better set the stage for the demo?\",\n",

       "   'Over the years and after the hundreds of demos I\\'ve both given and observed, there is one truism that I have come to know beyond a fraction of a doubt. In the context of a software demo, all questions are not created equally . What do I mean by that? Some questions are completely and totally irrelevant, as far as the success of the software deal is concerned. However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal. The challenge that we, as sales engineers face, is recognizing questions accordingly and knowing how to handle them, multiple times in any demo, on the fly, in front of an audience. That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ? The answers to these two questions will dictate how we handle questions from the audience.',\n",
       "   'Let\\'s review what we have covered so far in this book. We opened with the notion that we are in sales and talked about the importance of having that mindset. We established the goal of technical presales which is to get the Technical Win . We have talked through the first four habits, which are: Habit #1 - to PARTNER with our sales counterparts and develop an effective working relationship. The central theme being \"Sales is a team sport\". Habit #2 - to PROBE into customer requests for a demonstration to understand their objectives, requirements, etc. and the importance of hosting a Technical Discovery Call. Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\". If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\". They are all related to what happens before the demo. They are critically important to and will go a long way towards ensuring our success. But at the end of the day, at some point, the spotlight is going to be on us. Our sales counterpart is going to say what he or she has to say, for better or for worse, and then they are going to \\'hand',\n",
       "   \"Technical discovery is different from traditional sales qualification and discovery. We see and hear things different than our sales counterparts. Our goal is to determine what we need to SAY, SHOW, and DO - in the context of the demo - in order to get the technical win. The opposite is to go in blind. Or go into the demo with only the information provided by our sales counterpart, which may or may not be enough for us to give a compelling demo. Every customer, opportunity and/or situation is unique. We need to lead with and demonstrate those capabilities that will mean the most to our audience, not to us. Remember the concept of the newspaper. What section of the newspaper would you read first? Discover the answer to this question for your prospect. Do this by asking good questions, that spawn from their responses. Be conversational. Don't badger the witness. Be effective and efficient with their time. And please remember to just LISTEN! And take good notes. Now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Formulate a plan and save it for the demo. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Discuss the approach with your sales counterpart 2. Budget time for technical discovery 3. Do your homework 4. Prepare a list of questions in advance 5. Ask questions that flow conversationally 6. Follow the prospect or customer wherever they go and ask questions accordingly 7. Lead the witness when appropriate 8. LISTEN,\",\n",
       "   \"The next best practice in delivering a winning demonstration is to know the players . What do we mean by this? Depending of course on the solution you sell, the size of the companies you sell to and other potential dynamics, whenever you give a software demonstration, chances are good that you'll be demonstrating to a group of people, as opposed to just one. Although certainly that happens as well. For arguments sake, let's assume that most of your demos are given to groups of five or more people. In most cases, you're going to have different people with different perspectives, different roles, different interests, and more importantly different responsibilities in the decision-making process - the purchase process. This is particularly true if you sell enterprise software. In fact, studies have shown that in the past five years enterprise software purchase decisions involve more people than ever before. Why is this important? Different people with different roles will have different interests and concerns about your software. The way you communicate and respond to one group needs to be very different from how you respond to others. Let's consider some examples. Some folks in the room will be prospective users of the tool or the platform. They are going to be interested in the specifics and nuances of the tool - how it works, how it will affect their day job, etc. They are going to be more detail- oriented in nature. You will likely have technical influencers in the room.\",\n",
       "   \"What does an effective partnership between sales engineer and sales even look like? Are there specific characteristics that can be readily, commonly identified that indicate partnership effectiveness? A resounding yes. Like all relationships, they will have different dynamics. Each one is unique. But below is a list of the most common aspects of a well-functioning partnership - the profile of an effective sales-SE partnership, if you will. Goals and objectives are clarified and aligned Effective communication between them Mutual respect for one another Division of roles and responsibilities established and clarified Each party takes responsibility for their part of a sale Clear expectations on a consistent basis A feedback loop has been built into the sales process Prioritize the customer and opportunity over personal agenda Show loyalty to the company, the product, and one another Proactively engage one another and their customers Does that sound like an effective partnership to you? Does it sound like the type of working relationship that would enable you to succeed? Do you currently have working relationships like the one described here?

It also requires the involvement of your sales counterpart - which brings us back to habit #1, the strength of the partnership. After every demo, schedule a debriefing with the sales rep that you partnered with on the demo. Ask him/her for feedback. What did they think worked particularly well? Was there anything they would like to see changed? Were they surprised or disappointed by anything? Was there anything that they were particularly impressed with? Did they see or sense something that maybe you didn't? Also, use this opportunity to provide some feedback to them. Is there anything they could do to better set the stage for the demo?\",\n",

The quality of your relationship with your \"sales counterparts\", will determine, to a great degree, your job satisfaction and the team\\'s overall success. If you are paired with a single sales rep, the two of you will work in tandem to identify, qualify, advance, and, ideally, close business. This is the model made famous by IBM. An account manager was assigned a sales engineer, and the two worked side by side to manage and execute sales opportunities. It\\'s a model that still exists today in many organizations. You may be assigned to a group of reps that can call on you at any time, regularly pulling you in different directions.

We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions.

When a requirement is discovered that the software doesn\\'t support particularly well. When some portion of the demo underperforms because of a lack of data or a weak configuration. When some part of the message or story or delivery fails to move the customer across the line.

They constantly and consistently strive to perfect their game, perfect their demo. Conversely, if something in a demonstration works particularly well.

That technique is referred to as the mini-close . What\\'s a \"mini-close\"? At face value, the mini-close looks a lot like a form of seeking feedback . It comes in the context of a question and is designed to get a response from the customer. However, what differentiates a mini-close from the questions we use to get the customer engaged is they are asked in such a way that require the customer to acknowledge, on some small level, that we\\'ve satisfied one of their requirements. What we are looking for with a mini-close is some level of commitment, if only in the very smallest measure. We are looking for a small step towards achieving the technical win. How does this work? Allow me to explain. If at some point in your demo you ask the following question, \"That was an important point.

If so, do they have any sample data that they could provide to ...\n",
      "  Chunk 2: So, there you have it - the six habits of highly effective sales engineers. If you want to become highly successful in this profession. Become highly sought after as the expert in the field. To be highly paid for your expertise. To be admired and welcomed by customers and revered by colleagues. To h...\n",
      "  Chunk 3: Over the years and after the hundreds of demos I've both given and observed, there is one truism that I have come to know beyond a fraction of a doubt. In the context of a software demo, all questions are not created equally . What do I mean by that? Some questions are completely and totally irrelev...\n",
      "  Chunk 4: Let's review what we have covered so far in this book. We opened with the notion that we are in sales and talked about the importance of having that mindset. We established the goal of technical presales which is to get the Technical Win . We have talked through the first four habits, which are: Hab...\n",
      "  Chunk 5: Technical discovery is different from traditional sales qualification and discovery. We see and hear things different than our sales counterparts. Our goal is to determine what we need to SAY, SHOW, and DO - in the context of the demo - in order to get the technical win. The opposite is to go in bli...\n",
      "  Chunk 6: The next best practice in delivering a winning demonstration is to know the players . What do we mean by this?

      "  Chunk 7: What does an effective partnership between sales engineer and sales even look like? Are there specific characteristics that can be readily, commonly identified that indicate partnership effectiveness? A resounding yes. Like all relationships, they will have different dynamics. Each one is unique. Bu...\n",

It also requires the involvement of your sales counterpart - which brings us back to habit #1, the strength of the partnership. After every demo, schedule a debriefing with...\n",
      "  Chunk 9: Understand that a software demonstration is a performance. Know how to engage with your audience. Set boundaries and know the players. Expect and answer questions.

      "  Chunk 10: Sales engineers rarely, if ever, work sales opportunities in isolation. As a sale engineer, you will be paired up with one or more sales reps. The quality of your relationship with your \"sales counterparts\", will determine, to a great degree, your job satisfaction and the team's overall success. If ...\n",

There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process. Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty.

However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions.

You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty.

As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers.

I believe the way in which we respond to questions has the greatest impact on winning or losing the deal. Why is this so important?

Assuming we've followed the guidance provided in this book - the partnership is in good standing, we've probed into the customer's request, we've prepared effectively, and we've practiced to verify that everything is working. As a result, we should feel pretty good going in and have a reasonably good idea of what to expect. Fact is, we have a fair amount of control over what we're going to say and do. What do we not have control over? What is it that's most difficult to anticipate? The questions we are going to be asked. We have no control over what we are going to be asked, in what context, by whom, and when.

If you are paired with a single sales rep, the two of you will work in tandem to identify, qualify, advance, and, ideally, close business. This is the model made famous by IBM. An account manager was assigned a sales engineer, and the two worked side by side to manage and execute sales opportunities. It\\'s a model that still exists today in many organizations. You may be assigned to a group of reps that can call on you at any time, regularly pulling you in different directions.

The biggest mistake that SEs make when running one of these calls is the moment they hear something that their software addresses - an objective, a requirement, a burning issue, etc. - they jump into \"sell and tell mode\", and forget all about the purpose of the meeting - discovery through asking questions. They latch on to one key point and start telling the prospect all about how their solution does this, and that. \"We can solve it this way and we can solve it that way.\" This is a big mistake and frankly, a lost opportunity. During the technical discovery call, now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Now is the time to ASK QUESTIONS. Probe deeper into their responses. And collect the information you need to create the most compelling, engaging, spot-on demo as possible. Period. In as nice a way as I can say it. Ask good questions. And then shut up and listen!

So how do we do this? What are we probing for? What information should we be trying to dig up in the context of the technical discovery call? The following is a list of things you should be looking for when you run the technical discovery call. 1. Goals/Objectives - at the end of the day, what are they trying to accomplish? What\\'s the mission? 2. Motivation - what is their motivation? Is there or was there a compelling event? Is there a change of leadership? Change in the business? Or are they just tired of dealing with X or not being able to do Y? Is the project related to an overarching corporate strategy or objective? 3. Burning Issues - what are the burning issues that are keeping people up at night, causing people to lose jobs, costing them money, wasting time, losing business, etc. 4.

Another mistake I\\'ve seen SEs make when trying to run a technical discovery call is, they ask questions in the context of their tool or from their vantage point, not that of their customer.

NO! NO! This is not technical discovery. This is basically asking the prospect to do your job for you. They have no idea what features they want you to show them.

But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery.

       "   'Sales engineers rarely, if ever, work sales opportunities in isolation. As a sale engineer, you will be paired up with one or more sales reps. The quality of your relationship with your \"sales counterparts\", will determine, to a great degree, your job satisfaction and the team\\'s overall success. If you are paired with a single sales rep, the two of you will work in tandem to identify, qualify, advance, and, ideally, close business. This is the model made famous by IBM. An account manager was assigned a sales engineer, and the two worked side by side to manage and execute sales opportunities. It\\'s a model that still exists today in many organizations. You may be assigned to a group of reps that can call on you at any time, regularly pulling you in different directions. You might also find yourself in a matrixed organization, in which case you\\'re one of a pool of resources that any sales rep with a specific requirement can call on. Regardless of the situation, or structure of your organization, your ability to collaborate with your sales counterparts and the quality of those relationships, will, to a large degree, dictate your success.

The biggest mistake that SEs make when running one of these calls is the moment they hear something that their software addresses - an objective, a requirement, a burning issue, etc. - they jump into \"sell and tell mode\", and forget all about the purpose of the meeting - discovery through asking questions. They latch on to one key point and start telling the prospect all about how their solution does this, and that. \"We can solve it this way and we can solve it that way.\" This is a big mistake and frankly, a lost opportunity. During the technical discovery call, now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Now is the time to ASK QUESTIONS. Probe deeper into their responses. And collect the information you need to create the most compelling, engaging, spot-on demo as possible. Period. In as nice a way as I can say it. Ask good questions. And then shut up and listen!

So how do we do this? What are we probing for? What information should we be trying to dig up in the context of the technical discovery call? The following is a list of things you should be looking for when you run the technical discovery call. 1. Goals/Objectives - at the end of the day, what are they trying to accomplish? What\\'s the mission? 2. Motivation - what is their motivation? Is there or was there a compelling event? Is there a change of leadership? Change in the business? Or are they just tired of dealing with X or not being able to do Y? Is the project related to an overarching corporate strategy or objective? 3. Burning Issues - what are the burning issues that are keeping people up at night, causing people to lose jobs, costing them money, wasting time, losing business, etc. 4. Success - what does success look like for them? Have they considered that? Do they even know? And how will they measure success? What KPIs are they using? 5. Requirements -',\n",

Another mistake I\\'ve seen SEs make when trying to run a technical discovery call is, they ask questions in the context of their tool or from their vantage point, not that of their customer. I\\'ve quite literally heard sales engineers open with \" So what are the features or capabilities of our tool that you\\'d like to see? \" NO! \"Which of our use cases do you think you fit into?\" NO! \"Which of our tools would you like me to show you?\" NO! NO! NO! This is not technical discovery. This is basically asking the prospect to do your job for you. They have no idea what features they want you to show them. They\\'re looking to you as the expert to show them how your solution satisfies their requirements.

But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address.

There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process. Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers. Clarifying roles and responsibilities For the partnership to function properly, it is critical that both parties understand the division of roles and who owns what.

Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

Wrong! This is so important in the context of a demo. If you just showed something that was supposed to be one of the more impressive capabilities of your platform - a feature that makes your product unique or specifically addresses one of their requirements. This should be one of the more poignant moments in your demo. If they don\\'t respond, do not forge ahead. If they didn\\'t like that , chances are they aren\\'t going to like what\\'s next.

There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process. Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers. Clarifying roles and responsibilities For the partnership to function properly, it is critical that both parties understand the division of roles and who owns what. First and foremost, the sales rep owns the',\n",
       "   'Sales engineers rarely, if ever, work sales opportunities in isolation. As a sale engineer, you will be paired up with one or more sales reps. The quality of your relationship with your \"sales counterparts\", will determine, to a great degree, your job satisfaction and the team\\'s overall success. If you are paired with a single sales rep, the two of you will work in tandem to identify, qualify, advance, and, ideally, close business. This is the model made famous by IBM. An account manager was assigned a sales engineer, and the two worked side by side to manage and execute sales opportunities. It\\'s a model that still exists today in many organizations. You may be assigned to a group of reps that can call on you at any time, regularly pulling you in different directions. You might also find yourself in a matrixed organization, in which case you\\'re one of a pool of resources that any sales rep with a specific requirement can call on. Regardless of the situation, or structure of your organization, your ability to collaborate with your sales counterparts and the quality of those relationships, will, to a large degree, dictate your success. The first habit of highly effective SEs is to PARTNER with you sales counterparts. Treat these relationships as partnerships .

The most successful SEs understand that they are in sales and recognize their role on the team. They understand that not unlike other partnerships - such as a marriage - it requires collaboration, give and take, negotiation, communication, etc. In this chapter, we're going to break this down and first look at what an effective partnership looks like. Fact is, these partnerships can be difficult. We'll discuss why that is and consider some of the fundamental differences between ourselves and our sales counterparts. Sometimes they do things that disrupt the relationship, but so do we. We will examine some of the common mistakes that we make and how to avoid them. We will then walk through the three fundamental aspects of developing this habit. First, recognizing that sales is a team sport. Second, the importance of clarifying roles and responsibilities.

Another mistake I\\'ve seen SEs make when trying to run a technical discovery call is, they ask questions in the context of their tool or from their vantage point, not that of their customer.

So how do we do this? What are we probing for? What information should we be trying to dig up in the context of the technical discovery call? The following is a list of things you should be looking for when you run the technical discovery call. 1. Goals/Objectives - at the end of the day, what are they trying to accomplish? What\\'s the mission? 2. Motivation - what is their motivation? Is there or was there a compelling event? Is there a change of leadership? Change in the business?

The biggest mistake that SEs make when running one of these calls is the moment they hear something that their software addresses - an objective, a requirement, a burning issue, etc. - they jump into \"sell and tell mode\", and forget all about the purpose of the meeting - discovery through asking questions. They latch on to one key point and start telling the prospect all about how their solution does this, and that. \"We can solve it this way and we can solve it that way.\" This is a big mistake and frankly, a lost opportunity. During the technical discovery call, now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Now is the time to ASK QUESTIONS. Probe deeper into their responses. And collect the information you need to create the most compelling, engaging, spot-on demo as possible. Period. In as nice a way as I can say it. Ask good questions. And then shut up and listen!

If you just showed something that was supposed to be one of the more impressive capabilities of your platform - a feature that makes your product unique or specifically addresses one of their requirements. This should be one of the more poignant moments in your demo. If they don\\'t respond, do not forge ahead. If they didn\\'t like that , chances are they aren\\'t going to like what\\'s next.

Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle.

Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms.

I believe the way in which we respond to questions has the greatest impact on winning or losing the deal. Why is this so important? Because going into any demonstration we know what it is that we are going to say. Assuming we've done our homework. Assuming we've followed the guidance provided in this book - the partnership is in good standing, we've probed into the customer's request, we've prepared effectively, and we've practiced to verify that everything is working. As a result, we should feel pretty good going in and have a reasonably good idea of what to expect. Fact is, we have a fair amount of control over what we're going to say and do. What do we not have control over? What is it that's most difficult to anticipate? The questions we are going to be asked. We have no control over what we are going to be asked, in what context, by whom, and when.

You might say something simple like, \"That was a key point. Did you follow that?\" \"Before I go on, are there any questions about what I just showed?\" Ask something to get your audience engaged and involved. More importantly, ask a question that will draw out some insight . What is it that we want to know as we\\'re going through our demos? 1. Do they understand what they are seeing? 2. Do they like what they are seeing? 3. Do they have any questions about what they are seeing? The answers to these questions should constantly be in your mind.

But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not.

The biggest mistake that SEs make when running one of these calls is the moment they hear something that their software addresses - an objective, a requirement, a burning issue, etc. - they jump into \"sell and tell mode\", and forget all about the purpose of the meeting - discovery through asking questions. They latch on to one key point and start telling the prospect all about how their solution does this, and that. \"We can solve it this way and we can solve it that way.\" This is a big mistake and frankly, a lost opportunity. During the technical discovery call, now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Now is the time to ASK QUESTIONS. Probe deeper into their responses. And collect the information you need to create the most compelling, engaging, spot-on demo as possible. Period. In as nice a way as I can say it. Ask good questions. And then shut up and listen!

NO! NO! This is not technical discovery. This is basically asking the prospect to do your job for you. They have no idea what features they want you to show them. They\\'re looking to you as the expert to show them how your solution satisfies their requirements. Please, please, please ask your questions in the context of your customers point of view, not yours. (OK. I\\'m off my soapbox now.) What if I\\'m dealing with some savvy prospects?

Whether you are a sales engineer, depend on sales engineers to close business, or manage sales teams that include sales engineers, you will benefit from this book. How do I define sales engineer? Anyone who is in what the industry commonly refers to as technical presales fits into this category. Traditionally, these are the engineers and technical experts within a software company that give product demonstrations in the context of a sales opportunity. You may or may not think of yourself as a sales engineer. You might not have the title of sales engineer.

There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process. Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers. Clarifying roles and responsibilities For the partnership to function properly, it is critical that both parties understand the division of roles and who owns what.

If we don't have trust in the relationship, if the partnership isn't solid, then this may be a big ask. That's why it's so critically important to establish that partner mentality first. Would this apply to everyone? Allow me to set some context. I have sold complex software platforms into complex technical scenarios virtually my entire career. Many of the demos I've had to give require customization to be effective, and often times, significant customization. Under these circumstances, the technical discovery call is crucial. You may, however, sell a less complex platform. Your demonstrations may require less customization. As such, the technical discovery call may be less critical. I'm still of the opinion that even if you sell a more straightforward product, and even if your demos require less customization, it is still good practice to hold a discovery call. How else are you going to know exactly what to show and how to position it? Remember, you're the one under the spotlight with the mouse in your hand.

       "   '\"Ah-ha. Now I get it. Now I see how and why you\\'re different.\" They are the moments, frankly, that make a demo a sales activity as opposed to a training activity. Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

Show that you understand their objective and give them the solution to get them there Storytelling Best Practices Here is a sample outline that lays out a series of storytelling best practices. Use this as a guide when you are building your demo script. 1. Establish the problem statement a. What is the current harsh reality? b. Why is this bad? c. Identify the symptoms d. Empathize 2. Give hope a. Describe the \"utopian solution\" b. Give them a vision for the future c. Address symptoms specifically 3. Demonstrate the vision a. Lead with the result - what does that utopia look like? b. Show them the \"magic behind the curtain\" c. Give them the taste of success, happiness, and freedom Pass the \"So What?\" Test The final thought I will leave you with in this chapter']},\n",

       "   \"- in the most efficient and expedient manner. What separates the highest performing sales engineers from the rest is not just that they prepare, it's the way in which they prepare and what they focus on that makes the difference. One of the most important themes of this chapter is understanding the difference between developing demo content vs. the demo script . Demo content is WHAT we are going to show. The demo script is what we are going to SAY, how we are going to say it, and the order in which we are going to say it. Incidentally, you can also think of this as the story you are going to tell as you flow through the demo. As engineers, we tend to focus on the content - what it is we are building - and not the story. And yet, the story is invariably more important than what we show. Without a story, and without context for how the demonstration the audience is being presented aligns with their objectives, it almost doesn't matter what we build; it's going to fall flat. However, with context, and a compelling story, the content that we build comes alive in the eyes of the audience. Problem is, when many of us prepare for a demo, the 'thing' we are building gets the lion's share of our attention and the story becomes an afterthought. That's precisely what we are going to address in this chapter. Another key theme of this chapter is\"]},\n",

Think of your demo as a story, not just a feature tour.  Remember the \"Ah-ha\" moments principle –  you need to create those \"Now I get it!\" moments that make your solution truly stand out.  Focus on building a clear narrative around the customer\\'s pain points and how your product solves them.  Start by establishing the problem, then paint a picture of the ideal solution, and finally, showcase how your product delivers that vision.  This will help you create a more engaging and impactful demo that leaves customers wanting more.',\n",

More importantly, these are practices that will make your job more enjoyable and more fulfilling, not to mention, enable you to sell more software and make more money.

In addition, you will be enabling them to make better purchase decisions - which of course, we hope is in our favor. It has been proven time and time again that the best product doesn't always win. But more times than not, the best demo does. How you perform on stage, more times than not, will be the difference between victory and defeat. Incidentally, this section arguably could have been a book of its own. In fact, many of the books in print about software demonstrations focus largely on this segment - what to say and how to say it, when presenting to a customer. We will cover a total 20 tips, techniques and best practices. They are organized into three sections: the pre-demo setup, the delivery, and getting the technical win.

There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process. Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers. Clarifying roles and responsibilities For the partnership to function properly, it is critical that both parties understand the division of roles and who owns what. First and foremost, the sales rep owns the',\n",

Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\". Pause and Let It Sink In When you do reach one of your ah-ha moments, remember to pause and let it sink in .

Wrong! This is so important in the context of a demo. If you just showed something that was supposed to be one of the more impressive capabilities of your platform - a feature that makes your product unique or specifically addresses one of their requirements. This should be one of the more poignant moments in your demo. If they don\\'t respond, do not forge ahead. If they didn\\'t like that , chances are they aren\\'t going to like what\\'s next. Stop and figure out why. Did they not understand? Were they not impressed? Did it not work the way they were expecting? Maybe they are just unsure, and they\\'re reserving judgment until it\\'s over.

The software wasn\\'t formally positioned in the \"threat analysis\" space. It\\'s quite possible that someone might consider what the software did as being a threat analysis capability on some level. It would depend on their definition or interpretation of threat analysis. And how do we know if we don\\'t ask? The worst part of it, in this particular case, was that it was finally an opportunity to engage the attendees in some dialogue.

We might not support it in the way you are thinking, but customers certainly use our software to minimize security risk. So, the answer might be yes.\" This is the difference between simply answering questions and using questions to begin a dialogue. We are not there to just answer technical questions.

I believe the way in which we respond to questions has the greatest impact on winning or losing the deal. Why is this so important? Because going into any demonstration we know what it is that we are going to say. Assuming we've done our homework. Assuming we've followed the guidance provided in this book - the partnership is in good standing, we've probed into the customer's request, we've prepared effectively, and we've practiced to verify that everything is working. As a result, we should feel pretty good going in and have a reasonably good idea of what to expect. Fact is, we have a fair amount of control over what we're going to say and do. What do we not have control over? What is it that's most difficult to anticipate? The questions we are going to be asked. We have no control over what we are going to be asked, in what context, by whom, and when. From my experience, it is how you handle those questions - how you respond to and address those questions - that will ultimately determine your success. Let's pick this apart a little.

       "   'Sales engineers rarely, if ever, work sales opportunities in isolation. As a sale engineer, you will be paired up with one or more sales reps. The quality of your relationship with your \"sales counterparts\", will determine, to a great degree, your job satisfaction and the team\\'s overall success. If you are paired with a single sales rep, the two of you will work in tandem to identify, qualify, advance, and, ideally, close business. This is the model made famous by IBM. An account manager was assigned a sales engineer, and the two worked side by side to manage and execute sales opportunities. It\\'s a model that still exists today in many organizations. You may be assigned to a group of reps that can call on you at any time, regularly pulling you in different directions. You might also find yourself in a matrixed organization, in which case you\\'re one of a pool of resources that any sales rep with a specific requirement can call on. Regardless of the situation, or structure of your organization, your ability to collaborate with your sales counterparts and the quality of those relationships, will, to a large degree, dictate your success.

The biggest mistake that SEs make when running one of these calls is the moment they hear something that their software addresses - an objective, a requirement, a burning issue, etc. - they jump into \"sell and tell mode\", and forget all about the purpose of the meeting - discovery through asking questions. They latch on to one key point and start telling the prospect all about how their solution does this, and that. \"We can solve it this way and we can solve it that way.\" This is a big mistake and frankly, a lost opportunity. During the technical discovery call, now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Now is the time to ASK QUESTIONS. Probe deeper into their responses. And collect the information you need to create the most compelling, engaging, spot-on demo as possible. Period. In as nice a way as I can say it. Ask good questions. And then shut up and listen! Remember, it typically takes four or five rounds of questions to get to the heart of what it is they are trying to accomplish.',\n",

We know why organizations typically purchase our software.

So how do we do this? What are we probing for? What information should we be trying to dig up in the context of the technical discovery call? The following is a list of things you should be looking for when you run the technical discovery call. 1. Goals/Objectives - at the end of the day, what are they trying to accomplish? What\\'s the mission? 2. Motivation - what is their motivation? Is there or was there a compelling event? Is there a change of leadership? Change in the business? Or are they just tired of dealing with X or not being able to do Y? Is the project related to an overarching corporate strategy or objective? 3. Burning Issues - what are the burning issues that are keeping people up at night, causing people to lose jobs, costing them money, wasting time, losing business, etc. 4. Success - what does success look like for them? Have they considered that? Do they even know? And how will they measure success? What KPIs are they using? 5. Requirements -',\n",

Thus, all of our questions need to be asked in the context of what THEY are trying to accomplish, what THEIR objectives are, what THEIR requirements are, etc. It is then our job to interpret and translate what they are saying into what it means in the context of our products. Another mistake I\\'ve seen SEs make when trying to run a technical discovery call is, they ask questions in the context of their tool or from their vantage point, not that of their customer. I\\'ve quite literally heard sales engineers open with \" So what are the features or capabilities of our tool that you\\'d like to see? \" NO! \"Which of our use cases do you think you fit into?\" NO! \"Which of our tools would you like me to show you?\" NO! NO! NO! This is not technical discovery. This is basically asking the prospect to do your job for you. They have no idea what features they want you to show them. They\\'re looking to you as the expert to show them how your solution satisfies their requirements. Please, please, please ask your questions in the context of your customers point of view, not yours. (OK. I\\'m off my soapbox now.) What if I\\'m dealing with some savvy prospects?

But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery.

There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process. Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers. Clarifying roles and responsibilities For the partnership to function properly, it is critical that both parties understand the division of roles and who owns what. First and foremost, the sales rep owns the',\n",
       "   '\"Ah-ha. Now I get it. Now I see how and why you\\'re different.\" They are the moments, frankly, that make a demo a sales activity as opposed to a training activity. Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

Wrong! This is so important in the context of a demo. If you just showed something that was supposed to be one of the more impressive capabilities of your platform - a feature that makes your product unique or specifically addresses one of their requirements. This should be one of the more poignant moments in your demo. If they don\\'t respond, do not forge ahead. If they didn\\'t like that , chances are they aren\\'t going to like what\\'s next. Stop and figure out why. Did they not understand? Were they not impressed? Did it not work the way they were expecting? Maybe they are just unsure, and they\\'re reserving judgment until it\\'s over.

We hadn\\'t hardly heard a word from anyone on the phone up until that point. It was our first opportunity to get the audience engaged. Although the SE in this case was technically correct. The software wasn\\'t formally positioned in the \"threat analysis\" space. It\\'s quite possible that someone might consider what the software did as being a threat analysis capability on some level. It would depend on their definition or interpretation of threat analysis. And how do we know if we don\\'t ask? The worst part of it, in this particular case, was that it was finally an opportunity to engage the attendees in some dialogue. They hadn\\'t hardly said a word up until that moment. We could have responded with, \"Good question. I\\'m glad you asked. Help me understand how you define threat analysis. We might not support it in the way you are thinking, but customers certainly use our software to minimize security risk. So, the answer might be yes.\" This is the difference between simply answering questions and using questions to begin a dialogue. We are not there to just answer technical questions.

INSIGHT: I've come to believe that the ability to answer questions effectively may very well be the most important skill we can develop. I believe the way in which we respond to questions has the greatest impact on winning or losing the deal. Why is this so important? Because going into any demonstration we know what it is that we are going to say. Assuming we've done our homework. Assuming we've followed the guidance provided in this book - the partnership is in good standing, we've probed into the customer's request, we've prepared effectively, and we've practiced to verify that everything is working. As a result, we should feel pretty good going in and have a reasonably good idea of what to expect. Fact is, we have a fair amount of control over what we're going to say and do. What do we not have control over? What is it that's most difficult to anticipate? The questions we are going to be asked. We have no control over what we are going to be asked, in what context, by whom, and when. From my experience, it is how you handle those questions - how you respond to and address those questions - that will ultimately determine your success. Let's pick this apart a little. Expect Questions\",\n",
       "   'Sales engineers rarely, if ever, work sales opportunities in isolation. As a sale engineer, you will be paired up with one or more sales reps. The quality of your relationship with your \"sales counterparts\", will determine, to a great degree, your job satisfaction and the team\\'s overall success. If you are paired with a single sales rep, the two of you will work in tandem to identify, qualify, advance, and, ideally, close business. This is the model made famous by IBM. An account manager was assigned a sales engineer, and the two worked side by side to manage and execute sales opportunities. It\\'s a model that still exists today in many organizations. You may be assigned to a group of reps that can call on you at any time, regularly pulling you in different directions. You might also find yourself in a matrixed organization, in which case you\\'re one of a pool of resources that any sales rep with a specific requirement can call on. Regardless of the situation, or structure of your organization, your ability to collaborate with your sales counterparts and the quality of those relationships, will, to a large degree, dictate your success.

The biggest mistake that SEs make when running one of these calls is the moment they hear something that their software addresses - an objective, a requirement, a burning issue, etc. - they jump into \"sell and tell mode\", and forget all about the purpose of the meeting - discovery through asking questions. They latch on to one key point and start telling the prospect all about how their solution does this, and that. \"We can solve it this way and we can solve it that way.\" This is a big mistake and frankly, a lost opportunity. During the technical discovery call, now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Now is the time to ASK QUESTIONS. Probe deeper into their responses. And collect the information you need to create the most compelling, engaging, spot-on demo as possible. Period. In as nice a way as I can say it. Ask good questions. And then shut up and listen! Remember, it typically takes four or five rounds of questions to get to the heart of what it is they are trying to accomplish.',\n",

We know why organizations typically purchase our software. But rather than just going in to \"show up and throw up\", we want to tie everything we want them to see, with the specific problems they are trying to solve - the specific things they are trying to accomplish. So how do we do this? What are we probing for? What information should we be trying to dig up in the context of the technical discovery call? The following is a list of things you should be looking for when you run the technical discovery call. 1. Goals/Objectives - at the end of the day, what are they trying to accomplish? What\\'s the mission? 2. Motivation - what is their motivation? Is there or was there a compelling event? Is there a change of leadership? Change in the business? Or are they just tired of dealing with X or not being able to do Y? Is the project related to an overarching corporate strategy or objective? 3. Burning Issues - what are the burning issues that are keeping people up at night, causing people to lose jobs, costing them money, wasting time, losing business, etc. 4. Success - what does success look like for them? Have they considered that? Do they even know? And how will they measure success? What KPIs are they using? 5. Requirements -',\n",

Thus, all of our questions need to be asked in the context of what THEY are trying to accomplish, what THEIR objectives are, what THEIR requirements are, etc. It is then our job to interpret and translate what they are saying into what it means in the context of our products. Another mistake I\\'ve seen SEs make when trying to run a technical discovery call is, they ask questions in the context of their tool or from their vantage point, not that of their customer. I\\'ve quite literally heard sales engineers open with \" So what are the features or capabilities of our tool that you\\'d like to see? \" NO! \"Which of our use cases do you think you fit into?\" NO! \"Which of our tools would you like me to show you?\" NO! NO! NO! This is not technical discovery. This is basically asking the prospect to do your job for you. They have no idea what features they want you to show them. They\\'re looking to you as the expert to show them how your solution satisfies their requirements. Please, please, please ask your questions in the context of your customers point of view, not yours. (OK. I\\'m off my soapbox now.) What if I\\'m dealing with some savvy prospects?

But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery.

I believe the way in which we respond to questions has the greatest impact on winning or losing the deal. Why is this so important? Because going into any demonstration we know what it is that we are going to say. Assuming we've done our homework. Assuming we've followed the guidance provided in this book - the partnership is in good standing, we've probed into the customer's request, we've prepared effectively, and we've practiced to verify that everything is working. As a result, we should feel pretty good going in and have a reasonably good idea of what to expect. Fact is, we have a fair amount of control over what we're going to say and do. What do we not have control over? What is it that's most difficult to anticipate? The questions we are going to be asked. We have no control over what we are going to be asked, in what context, by whom, and when.

The quality of your relationship with your \"sales counterparts\", will determine, to a great degree, your job satisfaction and the team\\'s overall success. If you are paired with a single sales rep, the two of you will work in tandem to identify, qualify, advance, and, ideally, close business. This is the model made famous by IBM. An account manager was assigned a sales engineer, and the two worked side by side to manage and execute sales opportunities. It\\'s a model that still exists today in many organizations. You may be assigned to a group of reps that can call on you at any time, regularly pulling you in different directions.

The biggest mistake that SEs make when running one of these calls is the moment they hear something that their software addresses - an objective, a requirement, a burning issue, etc. - they jump into \"sell and tell mode\", and forget all about the purpose of the meeting - discovery through asking questions. They latch on to one key point and start telling the prospect all about how their solution does this, and that. \"We can solve it this way and we can solve it that way.\" This is a big mistake and frankly, a lost opportunity. During the technical discovery call, now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Now is the time to ASK QUESTIONS. Probe deeper into their responses. And collect the information you need to create the most compelling, engaging, spot-on demo as possible. Period. In as nice a way as I can say it. Ask good questions. And then shut up and listen!

We know why organizations typically purchase our software. But rather than just going in to \"show up and throw up\", we want to tie everything we want them to see, with the specific problems they are trying to solve - the specific things they are trying to accomplish. So how do we do this? What are we probing for? What information should we be trying to dig up in the context of the technical discovery call? The following is a list of things you should be looking for when you run the technical discovery call. 1. Goals/Objectives - at the end of the day, what are they trying to accomplish? What\\'s the mission? 2. Motivation - what is their motivation? Is there or was there a compelling event? Is there a change of leadership? Change in the business? Or are they just tired of dealing with X or not being able to do Y? Is the project related to an overarching corporate strategy or objective? 3. Burning Issues - what are the burning issues that are keeping people up at night, causing people to lose jobs, costing them money, wasting time, losing business, etc. 4. Success - what does success look like for them? Have they considered that? Do they even know? And how will they measure success? What KPIs are they using? 5. Requirements -',\n",

Thus, all of our questions need to be asked in the context of what THEY are trying to accomplish, what THEIR objectives are, what THEIR requirements are, etc. It is then our job to interpret and translate what they are saying into what it means in the context of our products. Another mistake I\\'ve seen SEs make when trying to run a technical discovery call is, they ask questions in the context of their tool or from their vantage point, not that of their customer. I\\'ve quite literally heard sales engineers open with \" So what are the features or capabilities of our tool that you\\'d like to see? \" NO! \"Which of our use cases do you think you fit into?\" NO! \"Which of our tools would you like me to show you?\" NO! NO! NO! This is not technical discovery. This is basically asking the prospect to do your job for you. They have no idea what features they want you to show them. They\\'re looking to you as the expert to show them how your solution satisfies their requirements. Please, please, please ask your questions in the context of your customers point of view, not yours. (OK. I\\'m off my soapbox now.) What if I\\'m dealing with some savvy prospects?

But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery.

Ending a meeting with no clear result is almost worse than ending with a loss. (Although the sales folks may not agree with that.) At least with a loss, you know where you stand, and you can assess your mistakes, learn from them and move on. Meetings that end in \"no decision\" are worse because you don\\'t know exactly where you stand. They may stay on the radar for months, taking up mental bandwidth, and never close.

What separates the highest performing sales engineers from the rest is not just that they prepare, it's the way in which they prepare and what they focus on that makes the difference. One of the most important themes of this chapter is understanding the difference between developing demo content vs. the demo script . Demo content is WHAT we are going to show. The demo script is what we are going to SAY, how we are going to say it, and the order in which we are going to say it. Incidentally, you can also think of this as the story you are going to tell as you flow through the demo. As engineers, we tend to focus on the content - what it is we are building - and not the story. And yet, the story is invariably more important than what we show. Without a story, and without context for how the demonstration the audience is being presented aligns with their objectives, it almost doesn't matter what we build; it's going to fall flat. However, with context, and a compelling story, the content that we build comes alive in the eyes of the audience. Problem is, when many of us prepare for a demo, the 'thing' we are building gets the lion's share of our attention and the story becomes an afterthought.

There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process. Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers. Clarifying roles and responsibilities For the partnership to function properly, it is critical that both parties understand the division of roles and who owns what.

Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery. So that over time, you can minimize the number of times you have to say NO. So that you can ultimately convince your audience to say YES\",\n",

However, if you find yourself speaking for 3-5 minutes without any questions or comments, get to a good breaking point, pause, and ask the audience an engaging question. You might say something simple like, \"That was a key point. Did you follow that?\" \"Before I go on, are there any questions about what I just showed?\" Ask something to get your audience engaged and involved. More importantly, ask a question that will draw out some insight . What is it that we want to know as we\\'re going through our demos? 1. Do they understand what they are seeing? 2. Do they like what they are seeing? 3. Do they have any questions about what they are seeing? The answers to these questions should constantly be in your mind.

More importantly, these are practices that will make your job more enjoyable and more fulfilling, not to mention, enable you to sell more software and make more money. It will also make the experience that much more satisfying for your prospects and customers. In addition, you will be enabling them to make better purchase decisions - which of course, we hope is in our favor. It has been proven time and time again that the best product doesn't always win.

In fact, many of the books in print about software demonstrations focus largely on this segment - what to say and how to say it, when presenting to a customer.

Is it related to the software itself? Is it the demonstration - the story, the content, the flow? Is it in our delivery? Are we failing to apply some of the rules from the previous chapter, like seeking feedback or responding to questions appropriately? Ending a meeting with no clear result is almost worse than ending with a loss. (Although the sales folks may not agree with that.) At least with a loss, you know where you stand, and you can assess your mistakes, learn from them and move on. Meetings that end in \"no decision\" are worse because you don\\'t know exactly where you stand. They may stay on the radar for months, taking up mental bandwidth, and never close. Whenever you have a meeting that ends like this, work hard to identify what can be done to remove some of the uncertainty and ambiguity, and avoid it in future opportunities. How does this apply to me? During your demonstrations, pay very close to what works and what doesn\\'t. Observe the audience throughout the meeting. How do they respond to various aspects of the software and story? What questions did they ask and when? Were there questions you couldn\\'t answer? Was it a weakness in the product?

Fact is, these partnerships can be difficult. We'll discuss why that is and consider some of the fundamental differences between ourselves and our sales counterparts. Sometimes they do things that disrupt the relationship, but so do we. We will examine some of the common mistakes that we make and how to avoid them. We will then walk through the three fundamental aspects of developing this habit. First, recognizing that sales is a team sport. Second, the importance of clarifying roles and responsibilities.

Partner - Habit #1 is to partner with your sales counterpart. To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2. Probe - Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers\\' objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind. This requires a very keen understanding of the difference between preparing demo content vs. preparing the demo script or story.

The better relationship you have with your sales teams, the more deals you will be invited into, which gives you the best opportunity to maximize your earnings. Once you\\'ve assessed the demo yourself and received feedback from your sales partner, budget and schedule time to make those enhancements to the demo. Look for better ways to answer a certain question Build workarounds for requirements the tool doesn\\'t satisfy directly Change configurations to give and show a better answer Give feedback to the product teams if you discover known limitations Research topics you are less knowledgeable on Learn or practice elements of the platform you haven\\'t mastered Enhance data and views to look more compelling Over time you will build you own \"toolbox\" of customizations, configurations, and workarounds for questions the software cannot adequately address on its own. You will collect a set of \"canned responses\" to the most difficult questions that otherwise throw you off your stride or catch you off guard.

Focus on understanding their needs and challenges first.  This means asking open-ended questions that probe deeper into their objectives and requirements, rather than jumping into technical details.  Think of it like building a bridge between their world and your solution.  By understanding their \"Ah-Ha\" moments, you can tailor your explanations to resonate with them and make the technical concepts clear and relevant.

Instead of just clicking through the software, pause for a moment to ask the customer if they have any questions or if there\\'s anything they\\'d like to see in more detail.  This will help you anticipate and address their concerns proactively, demonstrating a deeper understanding of their needs.

After you\\'ve demonstrated a key feature or addressed a concern, pause for a moment and ask a question that encourages the customer to think about the solution in their own context.  For example, \"Now that you\\'ve seen how this works, can you imagine how this might help you address the account management challenges you mentioned earlier?\"  This will help you gauge their understanding and identify any potential roadblocks.

For example, you could have asked, \"Denis, tell me more about your current process for managing customer accounts. What are some of the biggest challenges you face in this area?\"  By **repeating the question** and **asking for clarification**, you can ensure that you\\'re addressing Denis\\'s real concerns and demonstrating your understanding of his business.  Remember, **a confused mind always says NO**, so make sure you\\'re **explaining but not over-explaining** and **using common terminology** that resonates with Denis.

Think about how you can use the \"check down\" system to ensure a smooth flow between topics.  Instead of just clicking through the software, pause for a moment to ask the customer if they have any questions or if there's anything they'd like to see in more detail.  This will help you anticipate and address their concerns proactively, demonstrating a deeper understanding of their needs.

To really drive that engagement, try incorporating some of the \"mini-close\" techniques from Habit #6.  After you've demonstrated a key feature or addressed a concern, pause for a moment and ask a question that encourages the customer to think about the solution in their own context.  For example, \"Now that you've seen how this works, can you imagine how this might help you address the account management challenges you mentioned earlier?\"  This will help you gauge their understanding and identify any potential roadblocks.  Keep practicing, and you'll become a master at building strong customer relationships!\n",

For example, you could have asked, \"Denis, tell me more about your current process for managing customer accounts. What are some of the biggest challenges you face in this area?\"  By **repeating the question** and **asking for clarification**, you can ensure that you're addressing Denis's real concerns and demonstrating your understanding of his business.  Remember, **a confused mind always says NO**, so make sure you're **explaining but not over-explaining** and **using common terminology** that resonates with Denis.

For example, you could say something like, \"Now that we've covered the basics of how the software works, let's take a look at some of the more advanced features.\"  Or, \"We've seen how easy it is to set up the software, now let's see how you can use it to solve a real-world problem.\"  By using transitions, you can help Denis stay engaged and understand the flow of the demo.

Instead of just clicking through the software, pause for a moment to ask the customer if they have any questions or if there's anything they'd like to see in more detail.  This will help you anticipate and address their concerns proactively, demonstrating a deeper understanding of their needs.  Remember, a confused mind always says \"no,\" so make sure you're explaining things clearly and concisely.  You've got this!\n",

      "Answer: Luiz's demo was generally clear, but he could improve on clarity by ensuring a smoother flow between topics and avoiding jargon that might not be familiar to the customer. He also needs to anticipate and address customer questions and concerns more effectively, demonstrating a deeper understanding of their needs.  Luiz should also pause for feedback and check for understanding to ensure the customer is following the demo.\n",
