However, to enhance clarity and customer engagement, Luiz should focus on simplifying his explanations and tailoring his language to the customer's level of understanding. This can be achieved by using analogies or real-world examples that relate to the customer's industry or specific needs. Additionally, checking in with the customer throughout the conversation to ensure comprehension can prevent misunderstandings. Encouraging Luiz to ask open-ended questions can also facilitate a more interactive dialogue, allowing him to gauge the customer's grasp of the information and adjust his approach accordingly. By balancing technical detail with clear, accessible communication, Luiz can enhance his effectiveness and foster stronger customer relationships.\",\n",
       " 'engagement': \"To build on Luiz's strengths, it's commendable that he actively encouraged questions and interaction, demonstrating his openness and willingness to engage with the customer. This approach lays a solid foundation for building rapport and trust. However, to enhance the effectiveness of these interactions, Luiz could benefit from incorporating strategic pauses in his conversations. By doing so, he can create space for the customer to process information and respond, fostering a more dynamic and reciprocal dialogue. This practice not only helps in gauging the customer's understanding but also uncovers potential concerns or interests that might not surface otherwise. Luiz might consider using open-ended questions to invite more detailed feedback and ensure the conversation remains a two-way street. By balancing his enthusiasm with attentive listening, Luiz can transform his interactions into more meaningful exchanges, ultimately leading to stronger customer relationships and more successful outcomes.\",\n",
       " 'relevance': \"To build on the feedback, it's important to recognize that Luiz demonstrated a strong understanding of the product by covering a comprehensive range of features, which is commendable. This shows his thorough preparation and product knowledge, which are crucial skills for a Sales Engineer. However, to enhance the impact of his demos, Luiz should focus on aligning the features he presents with the specific pain points and goals of the customer. By asking more probing questions at the beginning of the interaction, Luiz can gather valuable insights into the customer's unique challenges and priorities. This will enable him to customize his presentation, making it more relevant and engaging. Additionally, incorporating real-world examples or case studies that resonate with the customer's industry can further personalize the experience. Remember, the goal is to make the customer feel understood and confident that the solution is tailored to their needs. Keep up the good work, Luiz, and continue to refine your approach with these strategies.\",\n",
       " 'structure': \"To enhance the effectiveness of future demos, it's important to focus on creating a structured narrative that guides the customer through the product's features in a coherent manner. While Luiz demonstrated a strong understanding of the product's capabilities and was able to answer customer questions with confidence, the overall presentation would benefit from a more organized approach. One of Luiz's strengths is his ability to engage with the customer and address their specific needs, which is crucial for building rapport and trust. To improve, Luiz could start by outlining a clear agenda at the beginning of the demo, which will help set expectations and provide a roadmap for the session. Additionally, using transitional phrases and summarizing key points before moving on to the next topic can help maintain a logical flow. Practicing these techniques will not only enhance the clarity of the presentation but also ensure that the customer can easily follow and appreciate the value of the product.\",\n",
       " 'confidence': \"To build on Luiz's strengths, it's important to recognize his confidence and product knowledge as foundational assets in his role as a Sales Engineer. These qualities not only enhance his credibility but also foster trust with clients. To further elevate his delivery, Luiz could benefit from integrating more flexibility into his presentations. By moving away from a strict script, he can engage more dynamically with his audience, allowing for a more natural and responsive interaction. Practicing active listening techniques will also help him manage and reduce interruptions in his speech, ensuring smoother communication. Encouraging Luiz to participate in role-playing exercises or mock presentations could provide a safe space to experiment with these strategies, ultimately enhancing his adaptability and professionalism. With these adjustments, Luiz is well-positioned to refine his delivery and make an even greater impact in his sales engagements.\"}"

      "To build on the feedback, it's important to recognize that Luiz's depth of knowledge and ability to provide detailed information is a significant strength, as it demonstrates expertise and can build customer trust. However, to enhance clarity and customer engagement, Luiz should focus on simplifying his explanations and tailoring his language to the customer's level of understanding. This can be achieved by using analogies or real-world examples that relate to the customer's industry or specific needs. Additionally, checking in with the customer throughout the conversation to ensure comprehension can prevent misunderstandings. Encouraging Luiz to ask open-ended questions can also facilitate a more interactive dialogue, allowing him to gauge the customer's grasp of the information and adjust his approach accordingly. By balancing technical detail with clear, accessible communication, Luiz can enhance his effectiveness and foster stronger customer relationships.\n",

      "To build on Luiz's strengths, it's commendable that he actively encouraged questions and interaction, demonstrating his openness and willingness to engage with the customer. This approach lays a solid foundation for building rapport and trust. However, to enhance the effectiveness of these interactions, Luiz could benefit from incorporating strategic pauses in his conversations. By doing so, he can create space for the customer to process information and respond, fostering a more dynamic and reciprocal dialogue. This practice not only helps in gauging the customer's understanding but also uncovers potential concerns or interests that might not surface otherwise. Luiz might consider using open-ended questions to invite more detailed feedback and ensure the conversation remains a two-way street. By balancing his enthusiasm with attentive listening, Luiz can transform his interactions into more meaningful exchanges, ultimately leading to stronger customer relationships and more successful outcomes.\n",

      "To build on the feedback, it's important to recognize that Luiz demonstrated a strong understanding of the product by covering a comprehensive range of features, which is commendable. This shows his thorough preparation and product knowledge, which are crucial skills for a Sales Engineer. However, to enhance the impact of his demos, Luiz should focus on aligning the features he presents with the specific pain points and goals of the customer. By asking more probing questions at the beginning of the interaction, Luiz can gather valuable insights into the customer's unique challenges and priorities. This will enable him to customize his presentation, making it more relevant and engaging. Additionally, incorporating real-world examples or case studies that resonate with the customer's industry can further personalize the experience. Remember, the goal is to make the customer feel understood and confident that the solution is tailored to their needs. Keep up the good work, Luiz, and continue to refine your approach with these strategies.\n",

      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "To enhance the effectiveness of future demos, it's important to focus on creating a structured narrative that guides the customer through the product's features in a coherent manner. While Luiz demonstrated a strong understanding of the product's capabilities and was able to answer customer questions with confidence, the overall presentation would benefit from a more organized approach. One of Luiz's strengths is his ability to engage with the customer and address their specific needs, which is crucial for building rapport and trust. To improve, Luiz could start by outlining a clear agenda at the beginning of the demo, which will help set expectations and provide a roadmap for the session. Additionally, using transitional phrases and summarizing key points before moving on to the next topic can help maintain a logical flow. Practicing these techniques will not only enhance the clarity of the presentation but also ensure that the customer can easily follow and appreciate the value of the product.\n",

      "To build on Luiz's strengths, it's important to recognize his confidence and product knowledge as foundational assets in his role as a Sales Engineer. These qualities not only enhance his credibility but also foster trust with clients. To further elevate his delivery, Luiz could benefit from integrating more flexibility into his presentations. By moving away from a strict script, he can engage more dynamically with his audience, allowing for a more natural and responsive interaction. Practicing active listening techniques will also help him manage and reduce interruptions in his speech, ensuring smoother communication. Encouraging Luiz to participate in role-playing exercises or mock presentations could provide a safe space to experiment with these strategies, ultimately enhancing his adaptability and professionalism. With these adjustments, Luiz is well-positioned to refine his delivery and make an even greater impact in his sales engagements.\n"

In fact, let's address this one now, because this is important. What are some ways in which you can diffuse a situation in which a salesperson has oversold a solution or overstated what the software can do? The following is a list of statements that you can make to downplay and redirect the conversation without making anyone look bad: What Bill said is true under certain circumstances, but given what you are trying to do… What Jason said is partially true, but the other side of the coin is… The fundamentals of what Mary said are true, but there are some specifics that may need clarification . What have we done here? First and foremost, we are being respectful to our sales counterparts. We're not throwing them under the bus. We're not saying No, that's not right. We're acknowledging the point they were trying to make. But then clarifying the point for the customer or prospect so we haven't left them with an expectation that the software cannot live up to. INSIGHT: To be sure I'm oversimplifying and generalizing here, but I do so to make a point. We tend to be driven more by our engineering background than our desire to close a deal.

Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers.

That\\'s why you\\'re going onsite to do a demo. The time to solve is coming. That\\'s what your post-sales consultants are responsible for. Remember, your goal is to get the technical win. And the goal of this technical discovery call is to collect as much information as you can to create the best demo possible. The more you talk during this call, the less information you are collecting. Take the trip Aslan Training, a sales training organization based in Atlanta, Georgia has a great term for this. They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe. If at any point, you stop to sell or stop to solve, until you have \"taken the trip\" all the way around the globe - meaning all the way around until you fully see the problem, the situation, the objective from their point',\n",

Technical discovery call We will cover this in great depth in Chapter 3 but suffice it to say here that it is important to develop the habit of speaking with the customer yourself before you commit to a specific date for the meeting. Regardless of how well your sales counterpart may have qualified the opportunity, you are going to want to hear with your own ears - directly from the prospect - their objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. 3.

In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind.

       "   'Develop the habit of preparing for demos with effectiveness and efficiency. It requires focus and discipline. The key is to remember the difference between preparing WHAT you are going to show (the demo content ) vs. what you are going to SAY, and how and when you are going to say it (the demo story ). Prepare extra or custom content only as necessary. Focus more on customizing the demo story. Prepare content with the story in mind. Remember, we tend to prepare more material than we can show in the time we have. As a result, we end up rushing through the most important content, and we water down our most important messages. Have the discipline to prepare as necessary but resist the temptation to over-prepare. Focus on your customer and their requirements, not your solution and what you like to talk about or demonstrate. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Build demo content plan and demo script outline based on what you heard during technical discovery 2. Strike a balance between the two 3. Negotiate enough time to prepare 4. Do so diligently and efficiently 5. Be sure to leave time to work on the demo story 6. Avoid preparing more than you can show in the time you have 7.

      "Answer: To build on the feedback, it's important to recognize that Luiz's depth of knowledge and ability to provide detailed information is a significant strength, as it demonstrates expertise and can build customer trust. However, to enhance clarity and customer engagement, Luiz should focus on simplifying his explanations and tailoring his language to the customer's level of understanding. This can be achieved by using analogies or real-world examples that relate to the customer's industry or specific needs. Additionally, checking in with the customer throughout the conversation to ensure comprehension can prevent misunderstandings. Encouraging Luiz to ask open-ended questions can also facilitate a more interactive dialogue, allowing him to gauge the customer's grasp of the information and adjust his approach accordingly. By balancing technical detail with clear, accessible communication, Luiz can enhance his effectiveness and foster stronger customer relationships.\n",

That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them.

The second, and arguably more importantly, it is necessary to keep the flow of the discovery call going. What\\'s the reverse? I\\'ve seen sales engineers get on a discovery call. They ask the overarching question, listen to the response, and then ask a follow-on question which is completely unrelated to what the prospect has just shared with them. This is such a big mistake. It gives the impression that they were not paying any attention to the response, and frankly, that they just don\\'t care. To illustrate this point - how to start with a key question and then follow it with more probing questions - see the graphic on the next page. The first figure represents an effective Q&A session, in which each question spawns from something the customer said. It represents the ideal flow of a discovery call. The second figure represents an ineffective flow.

It\\'s impractical to attempt to do so. Like the marathon runner, we should leave the final \"6 miles\" to the energy and adrenaline of the day.

In their words, \"They allow Perfection to become the enemy of Good Enough.\" Please understand what I\\'m saying here.

If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them. And typically, when you least expect it. The best laid plans, as they say, tend to go awry. As a good friend of mine once said, \"Life is what happens when you\\'ve made other plans.\" No truer statements can be said of a software demo. As',\n",
       "   \"he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery. So that over time, you can minimize the number of times you have to say NO. So that you can ultimately convince your audience to say YES - and get the TECHNICAL WIN . •••\",\n",
       "   'book on how to run a marathon, so don\\'t beat me up if I\\'m off base here.) The point is that it\\'s not realistic to think that we can create the perfect demo and attempt to prepare, in advance, every single thing we might have to cover. It\\'s impractical to attempt to do so. Like the marathon runner, we should leave the final \"6 miles\" to the energy and adrenaline of the day. INSIGHT: One of the complaints I consistently hear from SE managers is around this notion of striving for perfection. They argue that one of their biggest issues is some of their SEs waste time prepping for demos because they are striving for perfection. In their words, \"They allow Perfection to become the enemy of Good Enough.\" Please understand what I\\'m saying here. I\\'m not suggesting that you strive for perfection at the expense of good enough. What I\\'m suggesting is to practice the habit of continual improvement. However, do be careful not to let \\'perfection\\' become the enemy of \\'good enough\\' (or your managers may come after me with shovels and pitch forks). Think \"Pursuit of Mastery\" When I say that Habit #6 is to perfect the demo, think the pursuit of mastery . In his book \"Drive\", Daniel Pink sites mastery as one of the three elements of what he calls Motivation 2.0, the theory that intrinsic drives are more powerful than extrinsic drives. He compares mastery to an asymptote. You may have learned the term']}}"

They don't pause and ask for feedback. They talk for 15, 20, 25 minutes without coming up for air. The audience may be confused, bored or disengaged, and the SE isn't even aware. Yes, this may be an extreme example. (And I'm certain none of you would make this mistake.) But I go to this length to emphasize the point. Seek feedback along the way. Stay tuned in to where your audience is and bring them along for the ride. I'm a little uncomfortable with this - seek feedback You might be uncomfortable with this - drawing people out. You might feel like you're prying or pressuring your audience. Admittedly, this does take some practice. And it takes some finesse. We don't want to come off like a high- pressure salesperson here.

Habit #2 is to PROBE into the requirements of any request for a demo from a prospective client or customer. It is the habit of digging deeper into a customer\\'s inquiry. What are their objectives? What are their requirements, constraints, expectations, previous experience, etc.? To do this effectively, we need to become masters at running, what I refer to as, the \"Technical Discovery Call.\"',\n",

You\\'re assessing the level of engagement so you can determine how much credence or priority you should place on this request. This is particularly important if you support multiple sales reps. If that is the case, you want to make sure that you are prioritizing those inquiries that are of highest value to you and the company. The goal is to work those opportunities in which we are engaged at the right level, tied to a budget, one a timeline, etc. Ideally you want to support \"real opportunities\" as opposed to scenarios in which the prospect is just \"kicking the tires\". Not that we never make time for \"informational\" demos that may lead to an opportunity down the road, but when you have competing requests and obligations, you want to be sure you are prioritizing correctly. Schedule time for technical discovery We will cover technical discovery in depth in the next chapter. However, in the context of Habit #1, it\\'s important to establish as a foundational understanding between you and your sales reps that technical discovery is something you require. Establish, up front, that you expect to have the opportunity to host a technical discovery call before a meeting is scheduled. This is an important building block of an effective partnership, and it should be included as part of the sales cadence. Budget time to prepare Another important topic to discuss with your',\n",

In this second segment of Habit #5 - PERFORM, we will cover the techniques necessary to effectively deliver the demo. You're now on stage, with mouse in hand, under the spotlight. These are the techniques that will make your demo a compelling and memorable performance.\",\n",
       "   'It is said that audiences tend to remember the first and last thing a speaker says. I wonder if the same is true for any given chapter of a book. I toyed with making this principle the first in this chapter. But, as you can clearly see, I decided to end with it. It\\'s because violating this one important principle undermines all the benefits of applying the other rules. It\\'s the foundation upon which all the others are based. Simply put, when you give a demonstration, no matter what, be yourself . As the very name of this chapter suggests - PERFORM - I do think of a software demonstration as a performance. I believe any time we stand in front of a professional audience - whether it\\'s giving a software demonstration, running a training class, or speaking at a conference, etc. - there\\'s an element of being a performer. We have to be \"on\". I think some people may be uncomfortable with this idea - that a software demonstration is a performance . It may be perceived as \"putting on a show\" or \"putting on an act\", which may have the connotation of being false or fake. That\\'s not what\\'s being suggested here in the least. Quite the contrary. Nothing could be further from the truth. To perform at your best in this role you need to be yourself. You need to be authentic . Do not try to be someone else. That would be fake. Many people in',\n",
       "   'So, what are we to do? How do we adopt and develop Habit #1 to PARTNER with our sales counterparts? There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process. Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions.

There are three things we need to do, a) get your mindset right, b) clarify roles and responsibilities, and c) follow a process. Sales is a Team Sport The first thing we need to do to develop this habit is to change our mindset. Sales is a team sport . It is not an individual sport. Yes, you are going to be looked at for individual performance. You will very likely not have a team of people reporting to you. However, you need to think of yourself as part of a team, particularly those of you who sell enterprise software, or complex technical solutions. The more complex the technology or broad the solution, the more likely you will find yourself working with multiple sales reps. You might even find yourself working with multiple sales engineers--each with a different expertise or specialty. Like any team sport, the different positions have different responsibilities that require different skills. As such, sales engineers, and the sales folks we are paired with, bring unique skills to the table. The effective merging and meshing of those skills produce the most sales, generate the most revenue, and deliver the most beneficial outcomes for customers. Clarifying roles and responsibilities For the partnership to function properly, it is critical that both parties understand the division of roles and who owns what. First and foremost, the sales rep owns the',\n",

The most successful SEs understand that they are in sales and recognize their role on the team. They understand that not unlike other partnerships - such as a marriage - it requires collaboration, give and take, negotiation, communication, etc. In this chapter, we're going to break this down and first look at what an effective partnership looks like. Fact is, these partnerships can be difficult. We'll discuss why that is and consider some of the fundamental differences between ourselves and our sales counterparts. Sometimes they do things that disrupt the relationship, but so do we. We will examine some of the common mistakes that we make and how to avoid them. We will then walk through the three fundamental aspects of developing this habit. First, recognizing that sales is a team sport. Second, the importance of clarifying roles and responsibilities. Third, the value of establishing an integrated sales-presales process and how to go about setting one up.\",\n",

If that is the case, you want to make sure that you are prioritizing those inquiries that are of highest value to you and the company. The goal is to work those opportunities in which we are engaged at the right level, tied to a budget, one a timeline, etc. Ideally you want to support \"real opportunities\" as opposed to scenarios in which the prospect is just \"kicking the tires\". Not that we never make time for \"informational\" demos that may lead to an opportunity down the road, but when you have competing requests and obligations, you want to be sure you are prioritizing correctly. Schedule time for technical discovery We will cover technical discovery in depth in the next chapter. However, in the context of Habit #1, it\\'s important to establish as a foundational understanding between you and your sales reps that technical discovery is something you require. Establish, up front, that you expect to have the opportunity to host a technical discovery call before a meeting is scheduled.

Drawing from \"The Six Habits of Highly Effective Sales Engineers,\" Luiz should aim to incorporate 3-5 such moments strategically throughout his demo, with the most impactful one occurring within the first few minutes. This approach not only grabs attention but also sets the stage for a memorable presentation. Additionally, understanding the diverse roles and interests of the audience is vital. Tailoring the demo to address the specific concerns of different stakeholders can significantly improve engagement and relevance. Luiz should practice pausing after each \"ah-ha\" moment to allow the audience to absorb the information, fostering a deeper understanding. By focusing on these techniques, Luiz can transform his demos from technical monologues into compelling narratives that resonate with his audience, ultimately leading to more successful outcomes.',\n",

What I have learned (and seen) over the years is that there are very specific techniques that we can apply - that we NEED to apply - to dramatically increase our results. More importantly, these are practices that will make your job more enjoyable and more fulfilling, not to mention, enable you to sell more software and make more money. It will also make the experience that much more satisfying for your prospects and customers. In addition, you will be enabling them to make better purchase decisions - which of course, we hope is in our favor. It has been proven time and time again that the best product doesn't always win. But more times than not, the best demo does. How you perform on stage, more times than not, will be the difference between victory and defeat. Incidentally, this section arguably could have been a book of its own. In fact, many of the books in print about software demonstrations focus largely on this segment - what to say and how to say it, when presenting to a customer. We will cover a total 20 tips, techniques and best practices. They are organized into three sections: the pre-demo setup, the delivery, and getting the technical win. The first two are covered in this chapter. The third is covered in the next chapter. These two chapters will take\",\n",
       "   \"The next best practice in delivering a winning demonstration is to know the players . What do we mean by this? Depending of course on the solution you sell, the size of the companies you sell to and other potential dynamics, whenever you give a software demonstration, chances are good that you'll be demonstrating to a group of people, as opposed to just one. Although certainly that happens as well. For arguments sake, let's assume that most of your demos are given to groups of five or more people. In most cases, you're going to have different people with different perspectives, different roles, different interests, and more importantly different responsibilities in the decision-making process - the purchase process. This is particularly true if you sell enterprise software. In fact, studies have shown that in the past five years enterprise software purchase decisions involve more people than ever before. Why is this important? Different people with different roles will have different interests and concerns about your software.

Some folks in the room will be prospective users of the tool or the platform.

Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information.

This aligns with the principle of knowing the players, as understanding the diverse interests and roles of the audience allows Luiz to tailor these moments to resonate with each stakeholder. Practical advice includes starting with a powerful \"ah-ha\" moment within the first few minutes to grab attention and setting up each moment by clearly articulating the problem and its symptoms before unveiling the solution. Encouragement for Luiz would be to practice pausing after each \"ah-ha\" moment, allowing the audience to absorb the impact, and to actively seek feedback to refine his approach, ensuring clarity and engagement throughout the demonstration.',\n",

Depending of course on the solution you sell, the size of the companies you sell to and other potential dynamics, whenever you give a software demonstration, chances are good that you'll be demonstrating to a group of people, as opposed to just one. Although certainly that happens as well. For arguments sake, let's assume that most of your demos are given to groups of five or more people. In most cases, you're going to have different people with different perspectives, different roles, different interests, and more importantly different responsibilities in the decision-making process - the purchase process. This is particularly true if you sell enterprise software. In fact, studies have shown that in the past five years enterprise software purchase decisions involve more people than ever before. Why is this important? Different people with different roles will have different interests and concerns about your software. The way you communicate and respond to one group needs to be very different from how you respond to others. Let's consider some examples. Some folks in the room will be prospective users of the tool or the platform. They are going to be interested in the specifics and nuances of the tool - how it works, how it will affect their day job, etc. They are going to be more detail- oriented in nature. You will likely have technical influencers in the room.\",\n",
       "   '\"Ah-ha. Now I get it. Now I see how and why you\\'re different.\" They are the moments, frankly, that make a demo a sales activity as opposed to a training activity. Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

What separates the highest performing sales engineers from the rest is not just that they prepare, it's the way in which they prepare and what they focus on that makes the difference. One of the most important themes of this chapter is understanding the difference between developing demo content vs. the demo script . Demo content is WHAT we are going to show. The demo script is what we are going to SAY, how we are going to say it, and the order in which we are going to say it. Incidentally, you can also think of this as the story you are going to tell as you flow through the demo. As engineers, we tend to focus on the content - what it is we are building - and not the story. And yet, the story is invariably more important than what we show. Without a story, and without context for how the demonstration the audience is being presented aligns with their objectives, it almost doesn't matter what we build; it's going to fall flat. However, with context, and a compelling story, the content that we build comes alive in the eyes of the audience. Problem is, when many of us prepare for a demo, the 'thing' we are building gets the lion's share of our attention and the story becomes an afterthought.

By prioritizing the narrative, Luiz can create a more engaging and memorable experience for the audience. Additionally, adopting the \"less is more\" principle will help avoid overwhelming the audience and ensure that the demo fits comfortably within the allotted time. This approach not only allows for a more relaxed presentation but also provides space for audience interaction and questions, fostering a more dynamic and responsive environment.

What separates the highest performing sales engineers from the rest is not just that they prepare, it's the way in which they prepare and what they focus on that makes the difference. One of the most important themes of this chapter is understanding the difference between developing demo content vs. the demo script . Demo content is WHAT we are going to show. The demo script is what we are going to SAY, how we are going to say it, and the order in which we are going to say it. Incidentally, you can also think of this as the story you are going to tell as you flow through the demo. As engineers, we tend to focus on the content - what it is we are building - and not the story. And yet, the story is invariably more important than what we show. Without a story, and without context for how the demonstration the audience is being presented aligns with their objectives, it almost doesn't matter what we build; it's going to fall flat. However, with context, and a compelling story, the content that we build comes alive in the eyes of the audience. Problem is, when many of us prepare for a demo, the 'thing' we are building gets the lion's share of our attention and the story becomes an afterthought. That's precisely what we are going to address in this chapter. Another key theme of this chapter is\",\n",

Err on the side of \"less is more.\" If your audience likes what they see, but doesn\\'t get a chance to see everything, they will invite you back for more. If you try to show them too much, and it\\'s overwhelming or feels rushed or forced, you may not be invited back at all. Collaborate, Commit, and Schedule Once you have completed the content plan and demo script outline, review them with your sales counterpart. Be sure to explain your strategy and approach, and the overall theme or purpose of your demo. Ensure that it aligns with his or her strategy and approach. Call attention to the specific features, functions, and capabilities you plan to demonstrate, and again be sure that it aligns with what he/she expects to be shown. Allow time to discuss and negotiate any points of disagreement and/or confusion.

If there's anything I've learned to be true, it's that when we are in front of an audience, we are inclined to demonstrate whatever it is that we've built - regardless of whether there's enough time. As a result, once we get into the demonstration with the customer, we may press to get everything finished. We may end up feeling rushed. We may not allow time for questions so we can show everything we built. This has the potential to be a big problem. Be very wary of this. Too much content may also force us to be overly precise with our script - just to make sure we can fit everything in, even to the extent that we feel pressed to memorize the script. Which is simply a poor technique. It prevents us from being able to pivot and turn. We end up focusing too much on what we are going to say and not enough on what's happening in the room, or how our customers are responding, etc. For all these reasons, over preparation can be a very bad thing. Don't Build Content that Won't Be Shown The other related problem that sales engineers are notorious for is burning countless cycles developing demo content that is NEVER going to be shown. They spend time creating data, views, reports, screens, etc. that will never end up being used in a demo because it's just too much.

Additionally, focusing on the demo story rather than sticking rigidly to a script can help maintain a natural flow and engage the audience more effectively. Emphasizing the importance of preparation, Luiz should aim to balance the demo content with the narrative, ensuring that he doesn\\'t overwhelm the audience with unnecessary details. Encouraging Luiz to embrace the performance aspect of a demo, he should leverage \\'ah-ha\\' moments and seek feedback throughout, which will not only enhance his confidence but also improve his connection with the audience. Remember, continuous improvement is key, and with practice, Luiz will find that less is often more, leading to more impactful and memorable demos.',\n",
       "  'feedback_chunks': ['You have set and verified expectations. You know all the players and you are set and ready to go. The next critical ingredient of a winning demonstration is to begin with the end . In fact, this is the key tenet of Peter E. Cohan\\'s method and book, \"Great Demo!\" . As Peter puts it, \"do the last thing first\". This is something I was first introduced to in the classroom when I went through an internal training program that was based on his book, but something that has been proven to me repeatedly. This approach works. Period! Why do Peter and I and others like us make such a big deal of this concept? (Brian Geery, another author and recognized expert in the space refers to it as \"making the James Bond entry\" .) Because as SEs, we are SO tempted to tell our audience about all the work it took us to arrive at the results we got. We love to demonstrate how smart we are, and how clever and sophisticated the tool is. But here\\'s the problem. Nobody cares. At least not yet. Not now. All they care about at the outset of the demo is will the software do what we need it to do? And is this guy going to show us something impressive or bore us to death like most of the people we\\'ve seen? When you launch into your demo you want to show the most impressive, most compelling capability, screen, or aspect',\n",
       "   'Develop the habit of preparing for demos with effectiveness and efficiency. It requires focus and discipline. The key is to remember the difference between preparing WHAT you are going to show (the demo content ) vs. what you are going to SAY, and how and when you are going to say it (the demo story ). Prepare extra or custom content only as necessary. Focus more on customizing the demo story. Prepare content with the story in mind. Remember, we tend to prepare more material than we can show in the time we have. As a result, we end up rushing through the most important content, and we water down our most important messages. Have the discipline to prepare as necessary but resist the temptation to over-prepare. Focus on your customer and their requirements, not your solution and what you like to talk about or demonstrate. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Build demo content plan and demo script outline based on what you heard during technical discovery 2. Strike a balance between the two 3. Negotiate enough time to prepare 4. Do so diligently and efficiently 5. Be sure to leave time to work on the demo story 6. Avoid preparing more than you can show in the time you have 7. Aim to fill 50% of your allotted time with demo content 8. Remember the rule of the Capital T 9. Avoid the iceberg affect 10. Remember, often times, Less is More',\n",

      "Answer: To enhance Luiz's demonstrations, it's crucial to focus on creating those \"ah-ha\" moments that transform a demo from a mere presentation into a compelling sales activity. By strategically placing 3-5 such moments throughout the demo, Luiz can captivate his audience and clearly differentiate the product. This aligns with the principle of knowing the players, as understanding the diverse interests and roles of the audience allows Luiz to tailor these moments to resonate with each stakeholder. Practical advice includes starting with a powerful \"ah-ha\" moment within the first few minutes to grab attention and setting up each moment by clearly articulating the problem and its symptoms before unveiling the solution. Encouragement for Luiz would be to practice pausing after each \"ah-ha\" moment, allowing the audience to absorb the impact, and to actively seek feedback to refine his approach, ensuring clarity and engagement throughout the demonstration.\n",

INSIGHT: I recently had the opportunity to speak with Rob Falcone, Author of \"Just F*ing Demo\". On the topic of becoming roadblocks, he had this valuable insight to share: \"Having spent time as an SE and sales rep, I\\'ve been on both sides of the \"do we or don\\'t we demo?\" tug of war. Understand that this common friction can not only put the deal in jeopardy but will add unnecessary stress to your life! When this scenario inevitably arises, I\\'ve found it effective to step back and ask myself \"why?\" I\\'m feeling resistant to the demo. Maybe I feel the deal isn\\'t qualified. Maybe I don\\'t have sufficient requirements to build the demo. Once I can pinpoint why I\\'m resistant, I can work with the sales rep to address THAT in a way that not only eliminates stress, but also moves the deal forward.\" Great advice! Thanks Rob! The mistake that I see people make is when an account manager requests a demo and the sales engineer says flat out NO, without taking into consideration the request, the account, the deal size, etc. If you instantly decline requests like that,',\n",
       "   \"The diagram below is a graphical representation of this process flow. Figure 2: Example Presales Process This is just an example of the process that you can develop and maintain between yourself and the sales reps you work with. Must you always follow it precisely? Of course not. Are there times that you may have to cut some corners, or make some exceptions in the interest of a sale? Yes. But by establishing this up front and agreeing to the fundamental way of doing business, you will develop a much stronger relationship with your sales counterparts and create an effective partnership - which is precisely the goal. What if we disagree? There will be times when there's a disagreement or a difference of opinion on how to approach a sales opportunity. I encourage you to work out agreements with your sales counterparts up front. As an example, they are not to agree to a demo with a customer until they've discussed it with you first. Until they've given you a chance to review the requirements and do some discovery of your own, they are not to commit to a date. In return, you will be as responsive and efficient as possible. At the end of the day, it's in everyone's best interest. One of the worst things that sales reps can do to is commit to a date for a customer demonstration that requires more prep time than has been budgeted for. It puts us under the gun and the\",\n",
       "   \"Know what yours are. Discuss them with your sales counterparts. Determine the best way to address them. Build a satisfactory workaround. And avoid finding yourself in that sticky, uncomfortable position. At the end of the day, it's OK to make a mistake during a demo. It's OK to be unable to answer a question completely or effectively. But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery. So that over time, you can minimize the number of times you have to say NO. So that you can ultimately convince your audience to say YES\",\n",

Did you understand the significance of what I just showed you?\" The worst thing you can do - and I\\'ve seen it dozens of times - is to present one of your ah-ha moments, have it fall flat, and then, rather than pause and take the temperature of the room, barrel ahead with the demo, hoping that talking more and showing more will get the room more excited. Wrong! This is so important in the context of a demo. If you just showed something that was supposed to be one of the more impressive capabilities of your platform - a feature that makes your product unique or specifically addresses one of their requirements. This should be one of the more poignant moments in your demo. If they don\\'t respond, do not forge ahead. If they didn\\'t like that , chances are they aren\\'t going to like what\\'s next. Stop and figure out why. Did they not understand? Were they not impressed? Did it not work the way they were expecting? Maybe they are just unsure, and they\\'re reserving judgment until it\\'s over. That\\'s OK too. But as an SE, we want to know where our audience is mentally, before we continue.',\n",
       "   'Over the years and after the hundreds of demos I\\'ve both given and observed, there is one truism that I have come to know beyond a fraction of a doubt. In the context of a software demo, all questions are not created equally . What do I mean by that? Some questions are completely and totally irrelevant, as far as the success of the software deal is concerned. However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal. The challenge that we, as sales engineers face, is recognizing questions accordingly and knowing how to handle them, multiple times in any demo, on the fly, in front of an audience. That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ? The answers to these two questions will dictate how we handle questions from the audience.',\n",

Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them.

We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions.

That\\'s why you\\'re going onsite to do a demo. The time to solve is coming. That\\'s what your post-sales consultants are responsible for. Remember, your goal is to get the technical win. And the goal of this technical discovery call is to collect as much information as you can to create the best demo possible. The more you talk during this call, the less information you are collecting. Take the trip Aslan Training, a sales training organization based in Atlanta, Georgia has a great term for this. They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe. If at any point, you stop to sell or stop to solve, until you have \"taken the trip\" all the way around the globe - meaning all the way around until you fully see the problem, the situation, the objective from their point',\n",

The central theme being \"Sales is a team sport\". Habit #2 - to PROBE into customer requests for a demonstration to understand their objectives, requirements, etc. and the importance of hosting a Technical Discovery Call. Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\". If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\". They are all related to what happens before the demo. They are critically important to and will go a long way towards ensuring our success.

What if we disagree? There will be times when there's a disagreement or a difference of opinion on how to approach a sales opportunity. I encourage you to work out agreements with your sales counterparts up front. As an example, they are not to agree to a demo with a customer until they've discussed it with you first. Until they've given you a chance to review the requirements and do some discovery of your own, they are not to commit to a date. In return, you will be as responsive and efficient as possible.

But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery.

That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage.

We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions.

That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them.

We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance.

The central theme being \"Sales is a team sport\". Habit #2 - to PROBE into customer requests for a demonstration to understand their objectives, requirements, etc. and the importance of hosting a Technical Discovery Call. Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\". If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\". They are all related to what happens before the demo. They are critically important to and will go a long way towards ensuring our success.

Figure 2: Example Presales Process This is just an example of the process that you can develop and maintain between yourself and the sales reps you work with. Must you always follow it precisely? Of course not. Are there times that you may have to cut some corners, or make some exceptions in the interest of a sale? Yes. But by establishing this up front and agreeing to the fundamental way of doing business, you will develop a much stronger relationship with your sales counterparts and create an effective partnership - which is precisely the goal. What if we disagree? There will be times when there's a disagreement or a difference of opinion on how to approach a sales opportunity. I encourage you to work out agreements with your sales counterparts up front. As an example, they are not to agree to a demo with a customer until they've discussed it with you first. Until they've given you a chance to review the requirements and do some discovery of your own, they are not to commit to a date. In return, you will be as responsive and efficient as possible.

       "   \"Know what yours are. Discuss them with your sales counterparts. Determine the best way to address them. Build a satisfactory workaround. And avoid finding yourself in that sticky, uncomfortable position. At the end of the day, it's OK to make a mistake during a demo. It's OK to be unable to answer a question completely or effectively. But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery. So that over time, you can minimize the number of times you have to say NO. So that you can ultimately convince your audience to say YES\",\n",

Wrong! This is so important in the context of a demo. If you just showed something that was supposed to be one of the more impressive capabilities of your platform - a feature that makes your product unique or specifically addresses one of their requirements. This should be one of the more poignant moments in your demo. If they don\\'t respond, do not forge ahead. If they didn\\'t like that , chances are they aren\\'t going to like what\\'s next. Stop and figure out why. Did they not understand? Were they not impressed? Did it not work the way they were expecting? Maybe they are just unsure, and they\\'re reserving judgment until it\\'s over.

       "   'Over the years and after the hundreds of demos I\\'ve both given and observed, there is one truism that I have come to know beyond a fraction of a doubt. In the context of a software demo, all questions are not created equally . What do I mean by that? Some questions are completely and totally irrelevant, as far as the success of the software deal is concerned. However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal. The challenge that we, as sales engineers face, is recognizing questions accordingly and knowing how to handle them, multiple times in any demo, on the fly, in front of an audience. That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ? The answers to these two questions will dictate how we handle questions from the audience.',\n",

The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery.

But at least you have received it with an open mind, and if you don\\'t have the bandwidth, maybe you can find someone else or provide some support. INSIGHT: I recently had the opportunity to speak with Rob Falcone, Author of \"Just F*ing Demo\". On the topic of becoming roadblocks, he had this valuable insight to share: \"Having spent time as an SE and sales rep, I\\'ve been on both sides of the \"do we or don\\'t we demo?\" tug of war. Understand that this common friction can not only put the deal in jeopardy but will add unnecessary stress to your life! When this scenario inevitably arises, I\\'ve found it effective to step back and ask myself \"why?\" I\\'m feeling resistant to the demo. Maybe I feel the deal isn\\'t qualified. Maybe I don\\'t have sufficient requirements to build the demo. Once I can pinpoint why I\\'m resistant, I can work with the sales rep to address THAT in a way that not only eliminates stress, but also moves the deal forward.\" Great advice! Thanks Rob! The mistake that I see people make is when an account manager requests a demo and the sales engineer says flat out NO, without taking into consideration the request, the account, the deal size, etc. If you instantly decline requests like that,',\n",

But by establishing this up front and agreeing to the fundamental way of doing business, you will develop a much stronger relationship with your sales counterparts and create an effective partnership - which is precisely the goal. What if we disagree? There will be times when there's a disagreement or a difference of opinion on how to approach a sales opportunity. I encourage you to work out agreements with your sales counterparts up front. As an example, they are not to agree to a demo with a customer until they've discussed it with you first. Until they've given you a chance to review the requirements and do some discovery of your own, they are not to commit to a date. In return, you will be as responsive and efficient as possible.

He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery. So that over time, you can minimize the number of times you have to say NO. So that you can ultimately convince your audience to say YES\"]}}"

    "#### 1.3.1 Comparing naive and advanced RAG retrieval unsing UMAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding we use has many dimensions, but UMAP helps reduce it to just two. While this isn’t perfect, it gives us a visual idea of how close the query is to the retrieved chunks. This can be a sign of better retrieval — with more relevant content. The most important evaluation still comes from RAGAS metrics like Semantic Similarity, Faithfulness, and Context Precision, but this is still an interesting comparison to explore."

Every customer, opportunity and/or situation is unique. We need to lead with and demonstrate those capabilities that will mean the most to our audience, not to us. Remember the concept of the newspaper. What section of the newspaper would you read first? Discover the answer to this question for your prospect. Do this by asking good questions, that spawn from their responses. Be conversational. Don't badger the witness. Be effective and efficient with their time. And please remember to just LISTEN! And take good notes. Now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Formulate a plan and save it for the demo. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Discuss the approach with your sales counterpart 2. Budget time for technical discovery 3. Do your homework 4. Prepare a list of questions in advance 5. Ask questions that flow conversationally 6. Follow the prospect or customer wherever they go and ask questions accordingly 7. Lead the witness when appropriate 8. LISTEN,\",\n",

When they have a customer requesting a deep dive demo, the first thing they do is schedule me for a discovery call. This by the way builds upon Habit #1. If we don't have trust in the relationship, if the partnership isn't solid, then this may be a big ask. That's why it's so critically important to establish that partner mentality first. Would this apply to everyone? Allow me to set some context. I have sold complex software platforms into complex technical scenarios virtually my entire career. Many of the demos I've had to give require customization to be effective, and often times, significant customization. Under these circumstances, the technical discovery call is crucial. You may, however, sell a less complex platform. Your demonstrations may require less customization. As such, the technical discovery call may be less critical. I'm still of the opinion that even if you sell a more straightforward product, and even if your demos require less customization, it is still good practice to hold a discovery call. How else are you going to know exactly what to show and how to position it? Remember, you're the one under the spotlight with the mouse in your hand.

What are The Six Habits of Highly Effective Sales Engineers? 1. Partner - Habit #1 is to partner with your sales counterpart. To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2. Probe - Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers\\' objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind. This requires a very keen understanding of the difference between preparing demo content vs. preparing the demo script or story. In this chapter, I will reveal the most common mistakes SEs make and time wasters that interfere with preparing for demos. We\\'ll walk through a plan for how to stay',\n",

The coaching content emphasizes the importance of seeking feedback during demos, being aware of the audience's engagement, and avoiding lengthy, unclear explanations. It suggests that sales engineers should strive for clarity by summarizing key points, using simple language, and ensuring the audience understands the significance of the features being demonstrated. Additionally, it highlights the need for effective communication and preparation to achieve a technical win in sales demonstrations.\",\n",

Yes, this may be an extreme example. (And I'm certain none of you would make this mistake.) But I go to this length to emphasize the point. Seek feedback along the way. Stay tuned in to where your audience is and bring them along for the ride. I'm a little uncomfortable with this - seek feedback You might be uncomfortable with this - drawing people out. You might feel like you're prying or pressuring your audience. Admittedly, this does take some practice. And it takes some finesse. We don't want to come off like a high- pressure salesperson here. But we aren't in the business of giving lectures either. Those people are called teachers, which we are not. We are there for the audience's benefit. We are there to help them understand what our technology can do, how it can solve their problems and help them meet their objectives. We are there to help them make an informed purchase decision.

It puts us under the gun and the deal at risk. Customer Inquiry Review When a customer requests a demo, or a prospect agrees to a meeting that requires a demo, the first thing you need to do is review the customer situation before you agree to a schedule. Use this list of questions to assess the opportunity. 1. Who are we talking to? What is their role/level? 2. Are they technical? Management? Executive level? 3. What are they trying to accomplish? 4. How long have we been talking to them? 5. Have they seen our product or a demonstration before? 6. Are they current customers? 7. Are they familiar with our product or have they seen or used a product like ours? 8. Is a third party or consultant involved? 9. In what stage is the opportunity? 10. Is there a budget and project tied to the opportunity? 11. Are we talking to the decision makers? 12. Are they on a timeline? What are you doing here? You are doing your own due diligence.

Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\". If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\".

To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2.

In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3.

But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery.

However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal.

Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ?

However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal.

Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ?

That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them.

If we don't follow the habit of probing into customer requests - of running technical discovery calls in advance of a product demo - it basically means we are going in blind to a sales meeting. We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions.

That\\'s why you\\'re going onsite to do a demo. The time to solve is coming. That\\'s what your post-sales consultants are responsible for. Remember, your goal is to get the technical win. And the goal of this technical discovery call is to collect as much information as you can to create the best demo possible. The more you talk during this call, the less information you are collecting. Take the trip Aslan Training, a sales training organization based in Atlanta, Georgia has a great term for this. They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe. If at any point, you stop to sell or stop to solve, until you have \"taken the trip\" all the way around the globe - meaning all the way around until you fully see the problem, the situation, the objective from their point',\n",

Our goal is to determine what we need to SAY, SHOW, and DO - in the context of the demo - in order to get the technical win. The opposite is to go in blind. Or go into the demo with only the information provided by our sales counterpart, which may or may not be enough for us to give a compelling demo. Every customer, opportunity and/or situation is unique. We need to lead with and demonstrate those capabilities that will mean the most to our audience, not to us.

Do this by asking good questions, that spawn from their responses. Be conversational. Don't badger the witness. Be effective and efficient with their time. And please remember to just LISTEN! And take good notes. Now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Formulate a plan and save it for the demo. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Discuss the approach with your sales counterpart 2. Budget time for technical discovery 3. Do your homework 4. Prepare a list of questions in advance 5. Ask questions that flow conversationally 6.

Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\".

       "   'Over the years and after the hundreds of demos I\\'ve both given and observed, there is one truism that I have come to know beyond a fraction of a doubt. In the context of a software demo, all questions are not created equally . What do I mean by that? Some questions are completely and totally irrelevant, as far as the success of the software deal is concerned. However, in stark contrast to that, there will always be key questions, asked by key individuals, at key moments, that make or break the deal. The challenge that we, as sales engineers face, is recognizing questions accordingly and knowing how to handle them, multiple times in any demo, on the fly, in front of an audience. That\\'s pressure. For that, we need a system. We need a process. Assess the Person. Assess the Question Allow me to introduce to you a simple two-step process you can quickly use to determine, on the fly, the best way to handle any difficult question in any given demonstration. 1. Assess the person asking the question. Are they critical or central to the decision-making process or on the \"periphery\"? In other words, are they a key player or a non-key player ? 2. Assess the question being asked. Is it pertinent to the agreed upon scope and requirements, or irrelevant and unrelated? That is, is the question on-topic or off-topic ? The answers to these two questions will dictate how we handle questions from the audience.',\n",

If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them. And typically, when you least expect it. The best laid plans, as they say, tend to go awry. As a good friend of mine once said, \"Life is what happens when you\\'ve made other plans.\" No truer statements can be said of a software demo. As',\n",

If we don't follow the habit of probing into customer requests - of running technical discovery calls in advance of a product demo - it basically means we are going in blind to a sales meeting. We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions.

That\\'s why you\\'re going onsite to do a demo. The time to solve is coming. That\\'s what your post-sales consultants are responsible for. Remember, your goal is to get the technical win. And the goal of this technical discovery call is to collect as much information as you can to create the best demo possible. The more you talk during this call, the less information you are collecting. Take the trip Aslan Training, a sales training organization based in Atlanta, Georgia has a great term for this. They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe. If at any point, you stop to sell or stop to solve, until you have \"taken the trip\" all the way around the globe - meaning all the way around until you fully see the problem, the situation, the objective from their point',\n",

Or go into the demo with only the information provided by our sales counterpart, which may or may not be enough for us to give a compelling demo. Every customer, opportunity and/or situation is unique. We need to lead with and demonstrate those capabilities that will mean the most to our audience, not to us.

Do this by asking good questions, that spawn from their responses. Be conversational. Don't badger the witness. Be effective and efficient with their time. And please remember to just LISTEN! And take good notes. Now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Formulate a plan and save it for the demo. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Discuss the approach with your sales counterpart 2. Budget time for technical discovery 3. Do your homework 4. Prepare a list of questions in advance 5. Ask questions that flow conversationally 6.

So, if there is any disagreement on how to approach an account or an opportunity, they hold the ultimate trump card. As the sales engineer, it's our job to get the technical win. This, of course, is a big part of closing the deal and winning the opportunity. As such, we are responsible for proposing the technical approach and suggest how we need to position the solution and demo to get the technical win.

We established the goal of technical presales which is to get the Technical Win . We have talked through the first four habits, which are: Habit #1 - to PARTNER with our sales counterparts and develop an effective working relationship. The central theme being \"Sales is a team sport\". Habit #2 - to PROBE into customer requests for a demonstration to understand their objectives, requirements, etc. and the importance of hosting a Technical Discovery Call. Habit #3 - to PREPARE with both effectiveness and efficiency in mind, by understanding the critical difference between demo content vs. the demo script. Habit #4 - to PRACTICE before any given demo - especially for large, strategic opportunities, and the technique of \"click every click\". If we were to classify these four habits and the techniques and best practices related to them, they would fall under the heading of \"pre-demo activities\" or \"pre-demo best practices\". They are all related to what happens before the demo. They are critically important to and will go a long way towards ensuring our success. But at the end of the day, at some point, the spotlight is going to be on us. Our sales counterpart is going to say what he or she has to say, for better or for worse, and then they are going to \\'hand',\n",

To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2. Probe - Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers\\' objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind. This requires a very keen understanding of the difference between preparing demo content vs. preparing the demo script or story. In this chapter, I will reveal the most common mistakes SEs make and time wasters that interfere with preparing for demos. We\\'ll walk through a plan for how to stay',\n",

With so many competing objectives it is imperative that we establish a with process our sales counterparts and follow it. Here is the list of touch points that you need to collaborate with your sales counterparts on and establish process for. 1. Customer inquiry review When a customer inquiry or request comes in, or a prospect agrees to a meeting that requires a demo, the first thing we need to do is review the customer situation BEFORE we schedule the presentation and demo. 2. Technical discovery call We will cover this in great depth in Chapter 3 but suffice it to say here that it is important to develop the habit of speaking with the customer yourself before you commit to a specific date for the meeting. Regardless of how well your sales counterpart may have qualified the opportunity, you are going to want to hear with your own ears - directly from the prospect - their objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. 3. Demo preparation Be sure to negotiate enough time to prepare properly for the demonstration. This is covered in detail in Chapter 4. 4. Logistics and planning If the meeting requires on site access to the customer - be it local or long-distance travel - it requires planning\",\n",

Our goal is to determine what we need to SAY, SHOW, and DO - in the context of the demo - in order to get the technical win. The opposite is to go in blind. Or go into the demo with only the information provided by our sales counterpart, which may or may not be enough for us to give a compelling demo. Every customer, opportunity and/or situation is unique. We need to lead with and demonstrate those capabilities that will mean the most to our audience, not to us. Remember the concept of the newspaper. What section of the newspaper would you read first? Discover the answer to this question for your prospect. Do this by asking good questions, that spawn from their responses. Be conversational. Don't badger the witness. Be effective and efficient with their time. And please remember to just LISTEN! And take good notes. Now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Formulate a plan and save it for the demo. Action plan to develop this habit: 1.

What I have learned (and seen) over the years is that there are very specific techniques that we can apply - that we NEED to apply - to dramatically increase our results. More importantly, these are practices that will make your job more enjoyable and more fulfilling, not to mention, enable you to sell more software and make more money. It will also make the experience that much more satisfying for your prospects and customers. In addition, you will be enabling them to make better purchase decisions - which of course, we hope is in our favor. It has been proven time and time again that the best product doesn't always win. But more times than not, the best demo does. How you perform on stage, more times than not, will be the difference between victory and defeat.

In fact, many of the books in print about software demonstrations focus largely on this segment - what to say and how to say it, when presenting to a customer.

Fact is, these partnerships can be difficult. We'll discuss why that is and consider some of the fundamental differences between ourselves and our sales counterparts. Sometimes they do things that disrupt the relationship, but so do we. We will examine some of the common mistakes that we make and how to avoid them.

Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them. And typically, when you least expect it. The best laid plans, as they say, tend to go awry.

That\\'s why you\\'re going onsite to do a demo. The time to solve is coming. That\\'s what your post-sales consultants are responsible for. Remember, your goal is to get the technical win. And the goal of this technical discovery call is to collect as much information as you can to create the best demo possible. The more you talk during this call, the less information you are collecting. Take the trip Aslan Training, a sales training organization based in Atlanta, Georgia has a great term for this. They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe. If at any point, you stop to sell or stop to solve, until you have \"taken the trip\" all the way around the globe - meaning all the way around until you fully see the problem, the situation, the objective from their point',\n",
       "   \"work with the information we are provided, or none at all. If we don't follow the habit of probing into customer requests - of running technical discovery calls in advance of a product demo - it basically means we are going in blind to a sales meeting. We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions. The more complex the software you sell and/or the bigger the deal and/or the more people involved in the purchase decision, the more important this is. What sales reps hear correlates to\",\n",

And avoid finding yourself in that sticky, uncomfortable position. At the end of the day, it's OK to make a mistake during a demo. It's OK to be unable to answer a question completely or effectively. But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery.

This resulted in interactions feeling more like presentations than conversations, hindering deeper understanding of customer needs and failing to fully address concerns.

But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery.

If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them. And typically, when you least expect it. The best laid plans, as they say, tend to go awry.

That\\'s why you\\'re going onsite to do a demo. The time to solve is coming. That\\'s what your post-sales consultants are responsible for. Remember, your goal is to get the technical win. And the goal of this technical discovery call is to collect as much information as you can to create the best demo possible. The more you talk during this call, the less information you are collecting. Take the trip Aslan Training, a sales training organization based in Atlanta, Georgia has a great term for this. They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe. If at any point, you stop to sell or stop to solve, until you have \"taken the trip\" all the way around the globe - meaning all the way around until you fully see the problem, the situation, the objective from their point',\n",

We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance.

       "   'Congratulations! You\\'ve made it to the final chapter of the book. If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them. And typically, when you least expect it. The best laid plans, as they say, tend to go awry. As a good friend of mine once said, \"Life is what happens when you\\'ve made other plans.\" No truer statements can be said of a software demo. As',\n",

Remember, it typically takes four or five rounds of questions to get to the heart of what it is they are trying to accomplish. The time to sell is coming. That\\'s why you\\'re going onsite to do a demo. The time to solve is coming. That\\'s what your post-sales consultants are responsible for. Remember, your goal is to get the technical win. And the goal of this technical discovery call is to collect as much information as you can to create the best demo possible. The more you talk during this call, the less information you are collecting. Take the trip Aslan Training, a sales training organization based in Atlanta, Georgia has a great term for this. They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe. If at any point, you stop to sell or stop to solve, until you have \"taken the trip\" all the way around the globe - meaning all the way around until you fully see the problem, the situation, the objective from their point',\n",
       "   \"work with the information we are provided, or none at all. If we don't follow the habit of probing into customer requests - of running technical discovery calls in advance of a product demo - it basically means we are going in blind to a sales meeting. We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions. The more complex the software you sell and/or the bigger the deal and/or the more people involved in the purchase decision, the more important this is. What sales reps hear correlates to\",\n",
       "   \"Know what yours are. Discuss them with your sales counterparts. Determine the best way to address them. Build a satisfactory workaround. And avoid finding yourself in that sticky, uncomfortable position. At the end of the day, it's OK to make a mistake during a demo. It's OK to be unable to answer a question completely or effectively. But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery. So that over time, you can minimize the number of times you have to say NO. So that you can ultimately convince your audience to say YES\",\n",

Our goal is to determine what we need to SAY, SHOW, and DO - in the context of the demo - in order to get the technical win. The opposite is to go in blind. Or go into the demo with only the information provided by our sales counterpart, which may or may not be enough for us to give a compelling demo. Every customer, opportunity and/or situation is unique. We need to lead with and demonstrate those capabilities that will mean the most to our audience, not to us. Remember the concept of the newspaper. What section of the newspaper would you read first? Discover the answer to this question for your prospect. Do this by asking good questions, that spawn from their responses. Be conversational. Don't badger the witness. Be effective and efficient with their time. And please remember to just LISTEN! And take good notes. Now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Formulate a plan and save it for the demo. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Discuss the approach with your sales counterpart 2. Budget time for technical discovery 3. Do your homework 4. Prepare a list of questions in advance 5. Ask questions that flow conversationally 6.

Was it a weakness in the product? Was it a lack of knowledge or familiarity on your part? Did you find yourself painted into a corner as a result of anything you demonstrated? Take notes throughout your demo on things that you need to research, or change, or clean up. If you don\\'t have pen and paper, make mental notes as you go. The answers to all these questions indicate things that you can do to improve the demo before your next customer engagement. In some cases, there may not have been any negative moments in the demo, per se. There were no questions you couldn\\'t answer, no requirements you couldn\\'t address, etc. But the demo just felt a little flat at times. The story was a bit weak. The data was limited or inconsistent. The message was choppy. There are a range of things that can typically be done to spice up a demo and make it more enticing and engaging. Don\\'t wait until the next demo request to address these items. Before you receive another demo request and find yourself thrust back into the cycle of probe-prepare-practice-perform, take time to do some research.

Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

If at any point, you stop to sell or stop to solve, until you have \"taken the trip\" all the way around the globe - meaning all the way around until you fully see the problem, the situation, the objective from their point',\n",
       "   \"work with the information we are provided, or none at all. If we don't follow the habit of probing into customer requests - of running technical discovery calls in advance of a product demo - it basically means we are going in blind to a sales meeting. We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions. The more complex the software you sell and/or the bigger the deal and/or the more people involved in the purchase decision, the more important this is. What sales reps hear correlates to\",\n",
       "   \"Technical discovery is different from traditional sales qualification and discovery. We see and hear things different than our sales counterparts. Our goal is to determine what we need to SAY, SHOW, and DO - in the context of the demo - in order to get the technical win. The opposite is to go in blind. Or go into the demo with only the information provided by our sales counterpart, which may or may not be enough for us to give a compelling demo. Every customer, opportunity and/or situation is unique. We need to lead with and demonstrate those capabilities that will mean the most to our audience, not to us. Remember the concept of the newspaper. What section of the newspaper would you read first? Discover the answer to this question for your prospect. Do this by asking good questions, that spawn from their responses. Be conversational. Don't badger the witness. Be effective and efficient with their time. And please remember to just LISTEN! And take good notes. Now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Formulate a plan and save it for the demo. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Discuss the approach with your sales counterpart 2. Budget time for technical discovery 3. Do your homework 4. Prepare a list of questions in advance 5. Ask questions that flow conversationally 6. Follow the prospect or customer wherever they go and ask questions accordingly 7. Lead the witness when appropriate 8. LISTEN,\"]},\n",

       "   '\"Ah-ha. Now I get it. Now I see how and why you\\'re different.\" They are the moments, frankly, that make a demo a sales activity as opposed to a training activity. Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

More importantly, these are practices that will make your job more enjoyable and more fulfilling, not to mention, enable you to sell more software and make more money. It will also make the experience that much more satisfying for your prospects and customers. In addition, you will be enabling them to make better purchase decisions - which of course, we hope is in our favor. It has been proven time and time again that the best product doesn't always win.

Incidentally, this section arguably could have been a book of its own. In fact, many of the books in print about software demonstrations focus largely on this segment - what to say and how to say it, when presenting to a customer.

If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them. And typically, when you least expect it. The best laid plans, as they say, tend to go awry. As a good friend of mine once said, \"Life is what happens when you\\'ve made other plans.\" No truer statements can be said of a software demo. As',\n",

And avoid finding yourself in that sticky, uncomfortable position. At the end of the day, it's OK to make a mistake during a demo. It's OK to be unable to answer a question completely or effectively. But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery. So that over time, you can minimize the number of times you have to say NO. So that you can ultimately convince your audience to say YES\",\n",

Was it a weakness in the product? Was it a lack of knowledge or familiarity on your part? Did you find yourself painted into a corner as a result of anything you demonstrated? Take notes throughout your demo on things that you need to research, or change, or clean up. If you don\\'t have pen and paper, make mental notes as you go. The answers to all these questions indicate things that you can do to improve the demo before your next customer engagement. In some cases, there may not have been any negative moments in the demo, per se. There were no questions you couldn\\'t answer, no requirements you couldn\\'t address, etc. But the demo just felt a little flat at times. The story was a bit weak. The data was limited or inconsistent. The message was choppy. There are a range of things that can typically be done to spice up a demo and make it more enticing and engaging. Don\\'t wait until the next demo request to address these items. Before you receive another demo request and find yourself thrust back into the cycle of probe-prepare-practice-perform, take time to do some research.

They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe.

Post-demo discussion and lessons learned Meet with the sales rep after the fact to discuss what worked, what didn't, what needs to be changed, etc. Sometimes this happens in the car on the way back to the airport.

Here is the list of touch points that you need to collaborate with your sales counterparts on and establish process for. 1. Customer inquiry review When a customer inquiry or request comes in, or a prospect agrees to a meeting that requires a demo, the first thing we need to do is review the customer situation BEFORE we schedule the presentation and demo. 2. Technical discovery call We will cover this in great depth in Chapter 3 but suffice it to say here that it is important to develop the habit of speaking with the customer yourself before you commit to a specific date for the meeting.

You may, however, sell a less complex platform. Your demonstrations may require less customization. As such, the technical discovery call may be less critical.

This will help you craft a compelling narrative (Habit #5, \"Presentation and demo\") that flows logically, avoiding tangents.  By aligning your demo with the sales rep\\'s presentation (Habit #5 again), you ensure a cohesive message.

More importantly, these are practices that will make your job more enjoyable and more fulfilling, not to mention, enable you to sell more software and make more money.

       "   'Taking a page out of, \"Great Demo!\" by Peter Cohan, I\\'m going to do the last thing first. That\\'s right, I\\'m going to answer the most important question right now. What are The Six Habits of Highly Effective Sales Engineers? 1. Partner - Habit #1 is to partner with your sales counterpart. To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2. Probe - Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers\\' objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind. This requires a very keen understanding of the difference between preparing demo content vs. preparing the demo script or story. In this chapter, I will reveal the most common mistakes SEs make and time wasters that interfere with preparing for demos. We\\'ll walk through a plan for how to stay',\n",

Take notes throughout your demo on things that you need to research, or change, or clean up. If you don\\'t have pen and paper, make mental notes as you go. The answers to all these questions indicate things that you can do to improve the demo before your next customer engagement. In some cases, there may not have been any negative moments in the demo, per se. There were no questions you couldn\\'t answer, no requirements you couldn\\'t address, etc. But the demo just felt a little flat at times. The story was a bit weak. The data was limited or inconsistent. The message was choppy. There are a range of things that can typically be done to spice up a demo and make it more enticing and engaging. Don\\'t wait until the next demo request to address these items.

More importantly, these are practices that will make your job more enjoyable and more fulfilling, not to mention, enable you to sell more software and make more money. It will also make the experience that much more satisfying for your prospects and customers. In addition, you will be enabling them to make better purchase decisions - which of course, we hope is in our favor. It has been proven time and time again that the best product doesn't always win. But more times than not, the best demo does. How you perform on stage, more times than not, will be the difference between victory and defeat. Incidentally, this section arguably could have been a book of its own. In fact, many of the books in print about software demonstrations focus largely on this segment - what to say and how to say it, when presenting to a customer. We will cover a total 20 tips, techniques and best practices. They are organized into three sections: the pre-demo setup, the delivery, and getting the technical win.

Fact is, these partnerships can be difficult. We'll discuss why that is and consider some of the fundamental differences between ourselves and our sales counterparts. Sometimes they do things that disrupt the relationship, but so do we. We will examine some of the common mistakes that we make and how to avoid them. We will then walk through the three fundamental aspects of developing this habit. First, recognizing that sales is a team sport. Second, the importance of clarifying roles and responsibilities.

Demos should be built around the ah-ha moments. There should be 3-5 such moments in most demos, explicitly planted at optimal times. One of which - in fact the biggest of which - should be in the first 2-5 minutes of the demo. (We covered that in the section Begin with the End .) Everything else is setup and brief explanation. Any more than 3-5 ah-ha moments and the demo has the potential to become overwhelming. Anything less, and your demo probably is just a grand tour through the tool with too little sizzle. When you are giving your demonstration, be sure to know where those moments are; when they are coming. Use them to your advantage. Be sure to have everyone\\'s attention. Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them.

To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2. Probe - Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers\\' objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind. This requires a very keen understanding of the difference between preparing demo content vs. preparing the demo script or story. In this chapter, I will reveal the most common mistakes SEs make and time wasters that interfere with preparing for demos. We\\'ll walk through a plan for how to stay',\n",

Or go into the demo with only the information provided by our sales counterpart, which may or may not be enough for us to give a compelling demo. Every customer, opportunity and/or situation is unique. We need to lead with and demonstrate those capabilities that will mean the most to our audience, not to us. Remember the concept of the newspaper. What section of the newspaper would you read first? Discover the answer to this question for your prospect. Do this by asking good questions, that spawn from their responses. Be conversational. Don't badger the witness. Be effective and efficient with their time. And please remember to just LISTEN! And take good notes. Now is NOT the time to sell. Now is NOT the time to solve. Formulate a plan and save it for the demo. Action plan to develop this habit: 1. Discuss the approach with your sales counterpart 2. Budget time for technical discovery 3. Do your homework 4. Prepare a list of questions in advance 5. Ask questions that flow conversationally 6.

Take notes throughout your demo on things that you need to research, or change, or clean up. If you don\\'t have pen and paper, make mental notes as you go. The answers to all these questions indicate things that you can do to improve the demo before your next customer engagement. In some cases, there may not have been any negative moments in the demo, per se. There were no questions you couldn\\'t answer, no requirements you couldn\\'t address, etc. But the demo just felt a little flat at times. The story was a bit weak. The data was limited or inconsistent. The message was choppy. There are a range of things that can typically be done to spice up a demo and make it more enticing and engaging.

Be sure the key people are in the room. Be sure to set them up by describing the problem and elaborating the symptoms. The ideal situation is to bring the audience to the edge of their seat a little bit. Get them intrigued. Pique their curiosity. And then click, unveil the solution, the answer, the \"Wow\".

       "   'Congratulations! You\\'ve made it to the final chapter of the book. If you\\'ve come this far, you understand that the first five habits apply to what happens both BEFORE and DURING a sales demonstration. Habit #6 takes place AFTER a sales demonstration. Habit #6 is based on the principle of constant and consistent improvement. Habit #6 is to consistently strive to PERFECT your sales demonstration. That\\'s pronounced \"per-FECT\", as in the verb not the noun or adjective. Allow me to explain. No software package, platform, or tool is perfect. They all have their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. No demo is going to be perfect. OK, rarely is a demo ever going to be perfect. Regardless of how solid the relationship is with your sales counterpart. Regardless of how well you have probed, prepared, and practiced. Regardless of how strong your performance is on stage. Stuff happens. You will be thrown curveballs. Prospects will ask questions you can\\'t answer. They will request things the software cannot do. It will act up in front of the crowd. You will discover data and configurations that weren\\'t set up correctly. Etc. Etc. Etc. Simply put, stuff happens - no matter to what lengths you go to avoid them. And typically, when you least expect it. The best laid plans, as they say, tend to go awry. As a good friend of mine once said, \"Life is what happens when you\\'ve made other plans.\" No truer statements can be said of a software demo. As',\n",
       "   'compelling, engaging, spot-on demo as possible. Period. In as nice a way as I can say it. Ask good questions. And then shut up and listen! Remember, it typically takes four or five rounds of questions to get to the heart of what it is they are trying to accomplish. The time to sell is coming. That\\'s why you\\'re going onsite to do a demo. The time to solve is coming. That\\'s what your post-sales consultants are responsible for. Remember, your goal is to get the technical win. And the goal of this technical discovery call is to collect as much information as you can to create the best demo possible. The more you talk during this call, the less information you are collecting. Take the trip Aslan Training, a sales training organization based in Atlanta, Georgia has a great term for this. They call it \\'Take the Trip.\\' Imagine a picture of the globe. You are standing at the North Pole and your prospect is standing at the South Pole. When we begin the technical discovery call, I want you to imagine that you are on polar opposite positions with your prospect. With every question, you take a step closer to their side of the globe. If at any point, you stop to sell or stop to solve, until you have \"taken the trip\" all the way around the globe - meaning all the way around until you fully see the problem, the situation, the objective from their point',\n",
       "   \"work with the information we are provided, or none at all. If we don't follow the habit of probing into customer requests - of running technical discovery calls in advance of a product demo - it basically means we are going in blind to a sales meeting. We may have the information that our sales counterparts were able to extract and discover. And yes, we can present a standard, canned demonstration based on what he or she shared with us. We might even be able to create a semi-customized demo based on that information. But from my experience, as the person who is actually going to be standing in front of the customer, moving the mouse and talking through the demonstration, if I don't hear directly from the customer's mouth what it is they are trying to accomplish, what it is they are looking for, it leaves too much to chance. What's the problem relying on the information from our sales counterpart? There are numerous things. And no disrespect to the sales reps, but as we've established in an earlier chapter, they don't see the world the way we do. They are not the ones with fingers on the keyboard, and hands on the mouse. They are not the ones who will be challenged with difficult technical questions. The more complex the software you sell and/or the bigger the deal and/or the more people involved in the purchase decision, the more important this is. What sales reps hear correlates to\",\n",

And avoid finding yourself in that sticky, uncomfortable position. At the end of the day, it's OK to make a mistake during a demo. It's OK to be unable to answer a question completely or effectively. But if you find a recurring question, or a recurring problem and you don't address it when you have the time, that's not OK. My first boss in this profession had a system for this. Whenever he gave a demo, if he was asked to show something that he could not or if he was asked if the tool could do something that it could not. The next day, or before the next demo, he would spend time to develop a custom-built solution or workaround. Then, the next time he got that question, he had something prepared that he could show. It may not have been the ideal solution. It may not have been the perfect answer. But at least it was an answer. And after years of doing this, there were very few questions he couldn't address. He never reached perfection. But he also never ceased to strive for it. That's habit #6. To consistently strive to perfect your demo. To consistently strive for mastery.

When they have a customer requesting a deep dive demo, the first thing they do is schedule me for a discovery call. This by the way builds upon Habit #1. If we don't have trust in the relationship, if the partnership isn't solid, then this may be a big ask. That's why it's so critically important to establish that partner mentality first. Would this apply to everyone? Allow me to set some context. I have sold complex software platforms into complex technical scenarios virtually my entire career. Many of the demos I've had to give require customization to be effective, and often times, significant customization. Under these circumstances, the technical discovery call is crucial. You may, however, sell a less complex platform. Your demonstrations may require less customization. As such, the technical discovery call may be less critical. I'm still of the opinion that even if you sell a more straightforward product, and even if your demos require less customization, it is still good practice to hold a discovery call.

This proactive approach will directly address the observed lack of alignment with customer needs, boosting your perceived confidence.  Remember Figure 6 (\"Capital \\'T\\'\") –  prepare not just the demo content (Habit #3), but the entire narrative, anticipating questions and crafting compelling responses (Habit #5).  Practice pacing and actively manage hesitations through rehearsal and post-demo analysis.  By mastering these habits, you\\'ll transform your presentations from technically sound to powerfully persuasive, achieving the \"Technical Win\" (Habit #5).  Don\\'t be afraid to utilize the \"Demo Q&A Matrix\" (Figure 7) to structure your responses effectively.  Remember, consistent improvement comes from actively seeking feedback and refining your approach.',\n",

This will pay dividends down the road, in terms of your collective performance together in front of a customer and in terms of your own success. The better relationship you have with your sales teams, the more deals you will be invited into, which gives you the best opportunity to maximize your earnings.

You will collect a set of \"canned responses\" to the most difficult questions that otherwise throw you off your stride or catch you off guard.

       "   'Taking a page out of, \"Great Demo!\" by Peter Cohan, I\\'m going to do the last thing first. That\\'s right, I\\'m going to answer the most important question right now. What are The Six Habits of Highly Effective Sales Engineers? 1. Partner - Habit #1 is to partner with your sales counterpart. To think of your relationship with your sales counterpart as a partnership. Sales is a team sport, and you are on the same team. In this section, we will examine the different perspectives each player brings to the table, identify some mistakes to avoid, and offer a process for collaboration. 2. Probe - Habit #2 is to probe into any request for a demonstration. It is the habit of digging into a customers\\' objectives, requirements, expectations, etc. We do this by hosting a Technical Discovery Call, which we will discuss at great length. In the section, I will provide specific guidance on how to execute technical discovery, offer a list of questions you can use, and discuss other important clues to be on the lookout for that will shape how and what you demonstrate. 3. Prepare - Habit #3 is to prepare with effectiveness and efficiency in mind. This requires a very keen understanding of the difference between preparing demo content vs. preparing the demo script or story. In this chapter, I will reveal the most common mistakes SEs make and time wasters that interfere with preparing for demos. We\\'ll walk through a plan for how to stay',\n",

Before each demo, truly \"take the trip\" (as described in the training) to understand the customer's needs and pain points.  Ask open-ended questions to uncover their \"Ah-Ha\" moments (Habit #5, Perform) and avoid prematurely diving into technical details.  Remember, the goal of the discovery call is to gather information, not to sell.  Then, structure your demo around addressing those specific needs, ensuring a clear connection between features and benefits (Habit #3, Prepare).  Practice slowing down your pace (Habit #5, Perform) and using clear, non-technical language, avoiding jargon.  Finally, actively seek feedback during and after the demo (Habit #5, Perform) to identify areas for improvement and refine your approach for future presentations.  Remember, a successful demo is a collaborative process, not a lecture.\n",

The connection between features and customer pain points was inconsistently established, and concise explanations of key features were often missing.

      "Here's a summary of \"The Six Habits of Highly Effective Sales Engineers\" tailored for an experienced sales engineer, focusing on areas for refinement and advanced application:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Beyond the Basics: Refining the Six Habits for Expert SEs**\n",
      "\n",
      "This summary assumes familiarity with the core principles of the Six Habits (Partner, Probe, Prepare, Practice, Perform, Perfect).  It highlights opportunities for strategic improvement and nuanced application at an expert level:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Partner:**  Move beyond simple collaboration.  Develop a predictive partnership model with your sales counterparts.  Anticipate their needs and proactively address potential roadblocks *before* they arise.  Quantify the value of your contributions to the sales process, demonstrating a clear ROI on your time.  Negotiate resource allocation strategically, ensuring sufficient time for high-value opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Probe:**  Master the art of uncovering *unstated* needs and unspoken objections.  Go beyond basic discovery; conduct insightful explorations into the prospect's organizational culture, political landscape, and long-term strategic goals. Use advanced questioning techniques (e.g., hypothetical scenarios, strategic probes) to reveal hidden priorities.  Identify potential internal champions and opponents early on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Prepare:** Optimize for efficiency, not perfection. Employ the \"Capital T\" method (broad, shallow coverage with focused depth on key areas) to minimize preparation time without sacrificing impact. Develop modular demo content that can be easily adapted to various scenarios.  Focus on crafting compelling narratives that resonate with specific audience profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Practice:**  Go beyond \"clicking every click.\"  Simulate realistic scenarios, including unexpected questions and technical glitches.  Develop a robust \"check-down\" system for handling unplanned detours during the demo.  Practice your responses to common objections and challenging questions, emphasizing clear, concise, and confident delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Perform:**  Elevate your delivery to a strategic performance.  Master the art of the \"mini-close\" to secure small commitments throughout the demo, building momentum toward a final close.  Develop highly nuanced responses tailored to different audience segments (decision-makers, technical influencers, users).  Proactively manage audience engagement, employing techniques to address disengagement or lack of participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Perfect:** Implement a rigorous post-demo analysis system, incorporating feedback from both sales and prospects.  Quantify your results (e.g., deal win rate, deal cycle length improvements).  Identify and address recurring issues proactively, building a library of solutions and best practices for your team.  Use post-demo insights to influence product development and refine sales strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Focus Areas for Expert SEs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Strategic Account Planning:** Integrate the Six Habits into a comprehensive account strategy, anticipating future needs and opportunities.\n",
      "* **Data-Driven Optimization:** Track key metrics (demo success rate, deal win rate, etc.) to identify areas for improvement.\n",
      "* **Team Leadership:** Mentor and train junior SEs, sharing your expertise and best practices.\n",
      "* **Sales Enablement:**  Contribute to the development of sales collateral and training materials, leveraging your insights and experience.\n",

       "  'explanation': \"Luiz's demo, while showcasing many features, inconsistently connected them to Denis and Jane's specific needs and context.  He acknowledged customer concerns regarding existing systems, complexities, and data handling, but didn't always tailor the demo to directly address these, focusing more on general capabilities than problem-solving.  A key customer concern about territory alignment was deferred, indicating insufficient preparation. The presentation's relevance to the customer's unique challenges was inconsistent, with several sections feeling generic and irrelevant to their priorities and processes.\",\n",

Remember the \"newspaper analogy\"—lead with the section they care most about.  For Habit #3, let\\'s refine your demo planning.  Instead of showcasing every feature, prioritize a concise narrative focused on solving their key problems.  Create a demo script that weaves a compelling story around 3-5 \"ah-ha\" moments directly addressing their needs.  Practice this refined script rigorously (Habit #4) to ensure a smooth, confident delivery.  Remember, demonstrating relevance builds trust and increases the likelihood of securing the technical win.

Specifically, he needs to develop a more robust demo script that incorporates a clear narrative arc, prioritizing key \"ah-ha\" moments as per the \"begin with the end\" principle.  This involves crafting a compelling story that connects features to customer needs, identified during the Technical Discovery Call (Habit #2).  Pre-demo planning should include anticipating potential questions and crafting concise, focused responses that avoid lengthy tangents (Habit #5).  The \"check-down\" system can help manage unexpected questions without derailing the structure.

However, his confidence was occasionally undermined by a rushed pace, over-explaining, imprecise answers, insufficient product knowledge in some areas, and a wavering response to challenging questions or software limitations.  His preparedness also appeared insufficient at times, failing to anticipate specific customer needs.

This directly addresses the wavering responses to challenging questions and software limitations.  Meticulous preparation (Habit 3), emphasizing the demo script and story over solely content creation, will ensure he\\'s not caught off guard, reducing the rushed pace and over-explaining.  Finally, rigorous practice (Habit 4), including \"clicking every click\" on key demo features, will eliminate surprises and boost his assurance.

      "Answer: To improve clarity, Luiz should focus on Habit #2 (Probe) and Habit #3 (Prepare) before his next demo.  The lack of a concise problem statement and compelling value proposition indicates insufficient technical discovery (Habit #2).  Before the next demo, he needs a more focused Technical Discovery Call to clearly define the customer's pain points and desired outcomes.  This will inform a stronger narrative (Habit #3) that explicitly connects features to benefits, addressing the \"So What?\" test for each demonstrated capability.  Luiz should also prioritize Habit #5 (Perform), specifically focusing on slowing his delivery and avoiding excessive jargon.  Practicing the demo (Habit #4) with a clear, concise script that emphasizes the customer's needs will build confidence and ensure a smoother, more understandable presentation.  Remember, a confused mind always says no, so prioritize clarity above all else.\n",
